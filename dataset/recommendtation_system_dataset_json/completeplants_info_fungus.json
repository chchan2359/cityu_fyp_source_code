        "content": "Most of the diseases that give rise to leaf spots on otherwise healthy leaves are caused by various fungi, and fungi also cause diseases that result in root rot. However, plants that show dark, dirty-looking deposits on their leaves are probably not suffering from a fungal disease. Blackish 'dirt' is usually sooty mold, which grows on the honeydew excreted by sucking insects. You can rule out fungus as the problem if you can wash off the deposits with lukewarm, soapy water. As you clean away the sooty mold, look for its cause, which is likely to be scale, mealybugs, or another insect that sucks plant sap.  See page 268 for more information on these pests",
