        "content": "When a plant needs more space for its roots, it is shifted to a container only slightly larger than the one it was growing in before. This procedure is called potting up. When potting up, take care not to move a small plant into a very large container, which can lead to problems with root rot. When a plant is repotted into a container the same size as the one it was growing in before, it is called potting on, or simply repotting.",
