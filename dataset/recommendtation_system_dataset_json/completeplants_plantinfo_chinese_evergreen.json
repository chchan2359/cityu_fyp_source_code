      "content": "One of the easiest foliage plantsS to grow, Chinese evergreen tolerates low light better than most other houseplants. It features glossy, often variegated leaves that bend outward in an elegant arch. Very small plants, such as those included in dish gardens, will grow in plain water, or in a container filled with clean pebbles or marbles, until you are ready to pot them up. Large aglaonemas can reach 36 in/90 cm in height, but they normally stay much smaller; This plant has long had one weakness: a low tolerance for cold air. But newer cultivars are much less likely to be injured by low temperatures. Newer varieties also form thicker clumps, so mature plants stay bushy rather than growing upright. New growth of all aglaonemas emerges from the crown, so plants that grow too tall cannot be pruned back without killing them.",
