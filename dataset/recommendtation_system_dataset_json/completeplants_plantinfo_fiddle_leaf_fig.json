      "content": "With huge, slightly wavy, green leaves in the shape of a fiddle, this tropical fig is actually a tree capable of growing 40 ft/12 m tall in its jungle home. Indoors, plants grow very slowly, and can be kept for many years before they outgrow their space. The large, light-catching leaves grow to more than 12 in/30 cm long and 6 in/15 cm wide. When kept clean, they impart a lush, serene elegance to any indoor space; Fiddle-leaf fig is easy to grow, and can be trained into various shapes. To promote bushiness, prune off the top of a young plant. If you prefer a more treelike shape, allow the plant to grow tall, then clip off all leaves and branches from the lowest section of the trunk. Plants with braided trunks are available, too, and they are as simple to grow as single plants.  This species produces edible fruits when grown outdoors, but indoors it is strictly a foliage plant",

Plants may show no new growth until spring, but they should stop shedding leaves within a few weeks.
