        "content": "Pilea mollis is a bushy trailing plant that features clusters of ovate, toothed, textured, dark green leaves (to 3 inches long) with dark bronze undertones and often light green edges. Leaf undersides are typically dark red. Tiny pink-green flowers in branched cymes in summer are not particularly showy. Indoor plants rarely flower and fruit; Genus name comes from the Latin word pileus meaning a cap from the shape of the female flowers; Specific epithet means soft or with soft hairs; 'Moon Valley' is a more upright and mounding cultivar (to 12 inches tall) featuring textured bronze-green leaves with sunken purple veins and bright green margins. Leaf surface is strongly puckered in a way that purportedly resembles the surface of the moon, hence the cultivar name. 'Moon Valley' is also commonly sold in commerce as a cultivar of Pilea involucrata, but synonymity has not been conclusively determined.",
