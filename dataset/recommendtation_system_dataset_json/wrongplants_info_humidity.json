        "content": "Water moves through a plant's body through a process called transpiration. The roots absorb water from the soil, then move it upward through the stem and out into the leaves. Water, as a vapor, moves out of the leaf into the air through special pores called stomates. Losing water through its leaves is a vital and necessary process for your plant. Just as your heart beats to pump blood to every cell in your body, so transpiration bathes every cell in a plant's body in nutrients carried by water; If humidity is high a plant loses water more slowly from its leaves. If humidity is low a plant loses water rapidly from its leaves. Two other factors influence this process. First is the availability of water. If your potting medium is adequately moist then the plant is able to mine the soil with its roots for the water it needs. Conversely, if water is not available because you forgot to water and the medium is dry, then your plant can get into trouble quickly. The second factor is ambient air temperature. As the air temperature goes up humidity goes down; as the temperature goes down humidity goes up. Placing your plant too close to a hot air register or other heat source will suck the water right out of the leaves very quickly; Depending on your climate, dry or humid, you may need to mist your indoor plants about once a week, as we did when we lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In the Pacific Northwest, where we live now, many of our plants do not need misting, even in the dry summer months.",
