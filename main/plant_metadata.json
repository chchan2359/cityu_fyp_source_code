{"documents": ["Beyond regular grooming, one of the simplest ways to improve the appearance of your plants is to keep them clean. Like other indoor surfaces, plant leaves often collect dust, though they also filter dust from the air through their transpiration processes. Removing this dust helps the plants by improving photosynthesis and transpiration. Once-popular leafshine products make leaves extra glossy, but, like dust, they can block the leaf pores, making it difficult for plants to exchange gases and release moisture. Instead of using commercial waxes, try using a half-and-half mixture of milk and water to bring out the sheen in naturally shiny plant leaves; Wait until after your plants are clean and dry to wipe containers with a soapy cloth to remove dirt and fingerprints. This is also a good time to rinse out drainage trays - the final step in giving your entire indoor garden an orderly facelift.", "Plants with finer foliage can be cleaned with a gentle spray of water. In summer, it is usually easiest to take plants outdoors, set them in a shady spot, and spray them from all sides with a very fine spray of water. (If the pots need to be leached to remove excess salts, both tasks can be accomplished at the same time. ) To allow time for especially nasty deposits of dirt to soften, wait 10 minutes or so after the first shower and then spray plants again. Gently shake off water and allow the plants to dry in a place protected from strong sun before returning them to their usual place; If you must clean plants indoors, you can invite them into your shower or set them in a bathtub or sink and clean them with water from a spray bottle. Direct spray from a bathroom shower is often too harsh for houseplants, so the spray bottle method is usually best. Adding a few drops of dishwashing liquid to a quart of water in the spray bottle helps loosen dirt and dust so it floats off easily. Be sure to rinse cleaned plants well with lukewarm water before shaking off water droplets and returning plants to their places; To clean the foliage of plants with hairy or finely cut leaves, tape a plastic produce bag over the pot and soil, then swish the foliage in a pan of warm water. It helps to loosen the dirt if you mix a few drops of dishwashing liquid into the water; With some plants, such as ferns or others with fine leaf hairs that trap dust (velvet plant [Gynura] and piggy-back plant [Tolmiea] are two examples), you may want to submerge the foliage in warm, soapy water to get them clean. To avoid unnecessary mess, enclose the container and the base of the plant in a plastic bag, firmly taped in place. Fill a deep sink with lukewarm water with a small amount of dishwashing liquid added, and hold the plant upside-down while swishing it through the water. Allow the plant to drip dry before shifting it back into bright light.", "African violets and other plants with hairy leaves can be submerged, or you can use a soft paintbrush to sweep dust and debris from the leaves. African violets and some other hairy-leafed plants will develop leaf spots if water droplets do not dry promptly, or if the plant is exposed to bright sunlight while the leaves are wet. After cleaning, shake off excess moisture and turn on a gentle fan, which will circulate air and speed drying time; To clean spiny cacti, use a cotton swab to remove dirt and dust that persists after the plants have been sprayed with water; To prevent bruising of leaves, and to do a better job of cleaning leaf crevices, support the back of a leaf with one hand while sponging or wiping the other side. Be sure to clean both sides, because many pests hide on leaf undersides.", "Although it's a slow process, the best way to clean large-leafed plants is to do it by hand, one leaf at a time. Use a soft cloth or sponge and a pail of warm, soapy water, and support one side of the leaf with one hand while you wipe over the surface with the other. Clean both the top and undersides of each leaf. Along with dust and dirt, you may find yourself wiping up light infestations of spider mites and other tiny insects from leaf undersides. Don't hurry, because this can be a very enjoyable chore that gives amazing results. Scientists have pointed out that such intimate contact between plants and their keepers benefits both parties. As you gently work them over, your plants are bathed in your breath, which is rich in the carbon dioxide they crave.", "The containers you choose for your houseplants are the only home they know, but they are part of your home, too. This balancing act - providing containers that meet the needs of your plants while also pleasing you with their presence - is not difficult if you keep a few fundamental guidelines in mind. These include size, drainage, and material. When interior decor is your priority, it is usually best to choose the container before you choose the plant. Once the container and plant are in place, you may find that a third element, such aas a small piece of statuary, works magic in bringing the composition to life; Keep in mind that flat surfaces, such as floors, tabletops, and windowsills, are not the only places to keep plants. Various types of hardware - including hooks, chains, and fiber hangers - can be used to turn almost any container into a hanging basket, or you can use a container designed to be suspended from a hook. This is often a great way to give a plant bright light that might otherwise be wasted. When installing a hook in the ceiling or mounting hanging hardware on a wall, make sure it is firmly anchored into a joist (the solid pieces of wood behind sheetrock). Otherwise, only very light plants, such as tillandsias (air plants), will be suitable for hanging.", "Regardless of the material from which a container is made, its size should be proportional to that of its occupant. As a rule of thumb, measure the height of the plant from the soil line to the highest leaf. Divide this number by 3, and you have a good guess as to the ideal diameter of the container, measured in inches; Choose containers in proper proportion to the size of the plant. A container that is about one-third as tall as the plant often works best; This equation won't work with low-growing, vining plants or small, squat cacti, so the next size-wise guideline is to choose the smallest container that will accommodate the roots of the plant. There are two reasons to go small with containers. One is that small containers have a dwarfing effect on plant size, which is usually desirable under indoor conditions. Second, soil that is not employed in the service of roots tends to hold onto excess moisture, which in turn sets a tempting table for fungi that cause roots to rot; The diameter of the top of the pot (the measurement between opposite edges) is usually about the same as its depth. However, some plants with shallow surface roots do better in a low, squat container. Notice, too, that pots that narrow toward the base are prone to toppling over when planted with tall plants, though they are fine for small ones. Heavy pots with attached drainage dishes are often ideal for top-heavy plants. If a tall plant insists on tipping over, move it into a square planter that sits solidly in place.", "Whatever their size or shape, containers for plants must have drainage holes in the bottom through which excess water can escape. Several midsized drainage holes are better than one large one. Many gardeners place a piece of screen over the holes to keep soil from coming out along with excess water, but it is better to leave the holes unobstructed. That way, you can check for the presence of roots growing out of the bottom of the pot, and if drainage problems develop you can reopen the holes by poking them with a skewer, awl, or pencil. If soil loss is a big concern, simply line the bottom of the pot with a thin layer of pebbles or broken crockery when repotting your plants. A half inch of loose pebbles or broken crockery improves drainage too; Unfortunately, many beautiful brass, ceramic, or hand-thrown pottery planters do not include drainage holes. Holes can be drilled into plastic or fiberglass, but don't try this with fine ceramic or pottery. Instead, use these as cachepots, the term used to describe 'containers for your containers'.  Place an inch of clean pebbles in the bottom of the cachepot, and set your plant in a container that can be slipped inside the drainless one. (It's common to use a thin plastic pot for the inner one. ) As long as water is not allowed to form a deep puddle that keeps plant roots too wet, this double potting system works quite well. If you accidentally overwater, be sure to drain off any excess that pools up in the bottom of the cachepot; If a decorative container has no drainage holes, line the bottom with a layer of pebbles, and grow your plant in a well-drained container that can be slipped inside the prettier one and set on the pebble bed.", "When purchased, most plants are growing in plastic containers. Plastic is lightweight, holds moisture well, and seldom breaks as plants are packed and shipped. There certainly are attractive plastic containers, but those supplied by greenhouse growers are more practical than pretty. Once a plant has had a few weeks to adjust to conditions in its new home, a container upgrade is usually in order. Possible materials include clay, better plastic, fiberglass, and ceramic.", "It is hard to criticize the handsome good looks of a healthy houseplant situated in the favorite choice, a clean clay pot set atop pebbles in a matching tray. Earth-toned clay pairs well with plants, and in the interest of uniformity, some people grow all of their plants in clay pots. Because it dries quickly, clay is the preferred container material for plants that like periods of dryness between waterings, such as bromeliads and orchids. If you find that clay pots dry out too fast, you can paint their insides with paraffin or any color of latex paint. Or you can shop for dense Italian clay pots, which usually have 'Made in Italy' stamped on the bottom. These cost more than comparatively porous Mexican-made pots and are usually a shade darker in color.", "Always supplying superior moisture retention, plastic pots come in a variety of colors and finishes. Those with a dull matte finish often must be tapped with a finger to see if they are ceramic or plastic! Many plastic pots also have snap-on trays, which do a great job of capturing water that drips from the bottoms of the pots (an especially desirable feature for hanging baskets).  If you want a container in an unusual shape, such as an oblong box or a certain size of pedestal, you are most likely to find it in plastic.", "Designed to look like fine clay or ceramic, these are usually the pots of choice for formal living rooms. Good-quality fiberglass containers can be costly, but with a little care they will last a lifetime. Some contain enough metal to create a burnished finish, and fiberglass containers can be painted or antiqued if you want to make them fit a certain color scheme. Fiberglass containers are also quite lightweight, which makes them a top choice for large houseplants. Better garden shops carry fiberglass pots in a range of sizes and colors, including many that are replicas of classic Mediterranean styles. Select these with the same care you might put into choosing a piece of furniture; Smaller plants are most appropriate for ceramic containers, particularly pots that include an attached or matching drainage tray. When protected from abuse, ceramic containers often outlive the plants they are partnered with, so keep versatility in mind when investing in ceramic pots. Neutral grays and browns are easy to work with, and do not compete with plants for attention.", "Regard plant containers as a long-term investment. Choose containers that work well with your interior décor, suit your personal taste, and include drainage holes through which excess water can escape; THE MORE STRIKING THE FOLIAGE, the plainer the container should be. A glossy dark-leafed peace lily (Spathiphyllum) would look great in a gilt-trimmed Oriental pot, but a prayer plant (Maranta), with its dramatic, vividly marked and veined leaves, calls for a simple, single-colored container; Grow bulbs and other short-lived bloomers in plain plastic pots until they form buds. Then, to bring out their best, slip them into a decorative wicker basket and hide the interior container from view with moss; When a clay or ceramic pot breaks, pick up the larger pieces and then use a hammer to smash it into smaller pieces that can then be used to line the bottoms of containers. (You should always wear protective eyewear to avoid injury from flying pieces. ); Clean your plant containers between uses. Scrub pots with plenty of hot, soapy water and let them soak, if needed, to remove salt deposits around the rims; Grouping matching containers together is a good way to display plants with different forms, textures, and foliage colors.", "Unlike plants that live in the wild world of the outdoors, houseplants enjoy a comparatively clean environment, so they tend to have few problems with disease. However, their confinement in pots, with no way to escape stressful conditions, puts them at high risk for several common disorders. These disorders often look like diseases, and you are wise to consider both possibilities when working with a distressed houseplant; Most houseplant diseases - including leaf spots and diseases that cause stems and roots to rot - are caused by fungi. Fungi somewhat resemble plants in their life cycle. Microscopic spores germinate and use enzymes to penetrate plant cells. Using the cells as food, the fungus spreads until it becomes mature, at which time it releases thousands of new spores.", "Leaf spots caused by fungi may have a sunken middle or a dark place in the center of the spot - the 'fruiting' site that produces the next generation of spores. Removing leaves that show suspicious spots interrupts the life cycle by removing multitudes of potential spores. When a leaf-spotting disease is afoot, it also helps to keep leaf surfaces dry, because most of these fungi need damp leaf surfaces in order for spores to germinate and grow.", "Fungi that cause roots and stems to rot are more secretive, and by the time the plant wilts or becomes brown and mushy near the base it is very close to death. Overwatering often contributes to this problem, especially when combined with cool temperatures. Root rot also can become established when roots are damaged during repotting, because some root rot fungi can enter a host plant only through open wounds. Contaminated potting soil or dirty containers set the stage for disaster when roots are pruned during routine repotting; Whatever the cause, it is often futile to try to revive a plant that has suffered from rotting of its roots or basal stems. If a plant is shriveled or collapsed and you suspect root rot, remove it from its container and inspect the roots. Rotted roots are black or nearly disintegrated. Some soil-borne diseases destroy the fine root hairs and root sheaths, leaving only fragile, stripped fibers behind. Other fungal diseases leave roots intact until they have destroyed the plant by girdling stems near the soil line. Dark brown spots near the base of wilted stems are usually caused by fungal diseases. Some fungi coat the base of affected stems with fuzzy gray mycelium; Roots that are noticeably darker than others often have been damaged by fungi. Clip them off when repotting your plants; Plants plagued with rotting roots can sometimes be saved by propagating a healthy stem cutting, or you can simply discard the affected plant. Before using the container to grow a new plant, scrub it well with hot, soapy water, then dip it in a solution of ½ cup/118 ml chlorine bleach per gallon of water and let it dry in the sun.", "Fungicides are chemicals that kill or inhibit the growth of fungi, so it makes sense that using a fungicide might cure a disease problem. Unfortunately, this rarely works, for two reasons; Fungicides are best used preventatively, before a disease becomes serious, because they are more useful for stopping fungal spores from germinating than for routing out an established infection; Leaf tissues do not regenerate once they have been devastated by a fungal disease, so stopping the progress of the fungus does little to restore the health of the plant; Save your use of fungicides for outdoor plants at high risk of developing fungal diseases, and use them to prevent, rather than cure, fungus problems.", "Insects that feed by sucking plant sap, such as aphids and scale, excrete a sticky substance called honeydew, which in turn serves as an ideal home for dark-colored sooty mold. Sooty mold is often mistaken for fungus, but there is a major difference in that sooty mold does not invade leaf tissues. It can be removed using a soft cloth dipped in soapy water, and once leaves are clean they usually appear perfectly healthy. Sooty mold can occur on either side of a plant's leaves, or on both sides. When a plant shows patches of sooty mold, be sure to check for the presence of the pest that created the honeydew and take appropriate measures to bring it under control. In some situations, the sucking insect that began the problem cycle is gone by the time sooty mold develops on plant leaves.", "Much more frequently than they are weakened by disease, houseplants show symptoms of physiological disorders. One of the most common is brown leaf tips; most other disorders are easier to prevent; When you suspect that a plant is plagued by a disorder, go back to the basics. Make sure the plant is being given a fair chance in terms of light and temperature, and pay closer attention to watering and feeding. If you cannot provide suitable growing conditions for a certain plant, either discard it or give it to someone who can. Relieved of this needless aggravation, you can spend your energy nurturing plants that are more easily satisfied by the sites you have to offer.", "Occasionally pothos and other house-plants weep droplets of moisture when they are overwatered. Increasing air circulation while reducing watering solves this problem.", "Peperomia and some succulents actually suffer ruptured tissues when overwatering coincides with low light conditions. This condition, called oedema, causes corky bumps or ridges to form on stems and leaf undersides. Affected leaves may eventually turn yellow and fall from the plant. Keeping the plant warmer and watering less stops the damage; When forced to take up too much water, some plants develop bumpy ruptures in their leaves or stems, a condition called oedema.", "Plants shed leaves for a number of reasons, including over- or underwatering, changes in light or temperature, or as part of their normal growth pattern. Many plants shed a few leaves in the weeks immediately after they are moved, but if a plant continues to shed leaves despite good care, it should checked to see if it needs repotting. The combination of rootbound growing conditions and scant fertilizer often causes plants to turn yellow and shed their oldest leaves.", "Air pollution can cause plants to fail to thrive, and plants, like people, tend to slow down as they reach old age.", "One of the most common physiological disorders is the browning of leaf tips, which can be caused by tainted water, erratic watering, overfeeding, or a combination of factors. Plants with long, strappy leaves are most likely to develop brown leaf tips because moisture and nutrients must make such a long trip to keep cells at the leaf tips well supplied with moisture and nutrients; In many plants, brown leaf tips is a symptom of tainted water, uneven watering, or overfeeding.", "Diamonds may last forever, but houseplants seldom do. Sometimes their life spans are measured in mere weeks, while others may stay with you for decades. How do you decide when to give up on a struggling houseplant? Disposing of a houseplant often feels like a small death - the price we pay for our attachments to our green companions. Yet it is always best to allow plants to die when their time comes, and often even to hasten their death by pulling them from their pots, scattering the soil in an outdoor flowerbed, and then cleaning up the container to get it ready for a new tour of duty; Of course, you don't want to throw in the towel too soon. Some plants seem to be dead when they are merely dormant, so check the plant profiles in Parts 1 and 2 to see if your plant sometimes rests in a dormant state. Many plants that develop tuberous roots do rest between growth cycles, and it can be great fun to coax them back to life when they are ready; Plants may also respond to your help should they become overgrown and woody. Pruning them rather aggressively - and propagating some of the prunings as rooted stem cuttings - can accomplish two purposes: rejuvenating the parent plant, and creating vigorous young offspring. Plant propagation does involve time and trouble, so it is most appropriate for plants you truly like and want to keep around for future seasons of enjoyment; Be honest with yourself about this, because sometimes you may not like a plant, or perhaps you feel that it does not like you. This is a valid reason to let it go. If the plant is in good health, find it a new home. Its new owner may be delighted, and you can follow your heart to abetter plant choice for you-a win-win situation. Take what you learned from the plant about the site and care you have to offer, and use that knowledge to select a new plant that's a perfect match to the place and its keeper.", "If brown leaf tips drive you nuts, you can improve your plant's appearance by either snipping them off with sharp scissors or growing plants with round or blunt-tipped foliage. You can also use a razor blade to taper the cut when removing brown leaf tips. Whatever instrument you use, cut just outside the line where green leaf tissue turns to brown. Cutting into the green part of the leaf can cause a new brown margin to form.", "The process of flushing out the soil in a container by drenching it with water to remove excess salts is sometimes called double watering. And, in situations where a container has dried out completely, watering the plant twice will restore the moisture level in the pot.", "The process through which water moves through roots and soil is called drainage. When drainage is slow, roots are often forced to sit in water, which causes them to run short of oxygen and possibly rot. When drainage is very fast, roots may not have time to take up water before it disappears. How fast or slow a container drains depends on the size and number of drainage holes present in the bottom of the container and how well they are working, as well as on the texture of the potting medium and the density of plant roots. The size and shape of the container affects drainage, too. Tall, narrow containers tend to drain quickly near the top, though the bottom section of the container may still be very moist. Low, broad containers usually drain in a more uniform fashion; All houseplants require containers that have holes in the bottom through which excess water can escape, or drain away, yet they vary in their drainage requirements. Plants that grow best when they dry out between waterings - for example, most cacti and succulents, and some bromeliads and orchids - benefit from a planting system that provides fast drainage. Such a system is comprised of small containers with numerous drainage holes, filled with a very porous potting mix. Plants that prefer constant moisture around their roots fare better with moderate drainage, which is created by growing them in containers with fewer drainage holes and a dense, moisture-retentive potting mix; Your choice of container size and potting mix can be tailored to meet the needs of each plant, but with all plants it is important that the drainage holes remain open. The simplest way to do this is to line the bottoms of containers with a layer of coarse pebbles, shards of broken clay flowerpots or old dinner plates, or a few small stones, set so that water can flow around them and then out through the holes below. In addition to enhancing drainage, a loose layer of rocky fill keeps the potting medium from crumbling out through the bottoms of the pots. Small containers are fine with a thin layer of drainage material (or none at all), but larger pots need more help in the drainage department. In a 6-inch container, include 1 inch of rocky fill at the bottom, increasing to 2 inches in a 12-inch pot. To limit the weight of very large containers, you may include only 1 inch of rocky fill, covered with a couple of inches of foam packing peanuts; Gauge the depth of the layer of pebbles or broken crockery placed in the bottom of the container to the size of the pots. When using very large pots, you can increase the depth of the drainage layer without increasing weight by using foam packing peanuts atop a thin layer of pebbles.", "Despite the use of rocky fill, sometimes soil or roots block the drainage holes. If you thoroughly water a plant and little or no water drains out through the bottom, there is likely a problem with blocked drainage holes. Lay the pot on its side, and open any blocked holes with a slender skewer, awl, or pencil. Check the pot again the next time you water. If drainage is still slow, or if roots are emerging from the drainage holes, make plans to repot before root rot becomes a problem; Note also that the use of rocky fill in the bottom of the pot is not mandatory if you set pots atop trays filled with damp or dry pebbles, which accomplishes the same purpose in terms of drainage and provides an easy way to increase humidity near the plants. Some plants need every bit of space within the pot for roots, and little or no rocky fill gives them the room they need, while making it easier for you to examine the plant's root situation through the drainage holes.", "Many blooming houseplants include decorative wrappings over plain plastic pots. These wrappings also cover the drainage holes, which can cause serious problems for the plant. You can have the pretty wrappings and a healthy plant, too, if you take a few minutes to make necessary renovations. Choose among the options below for fixing this looming drainage problem; Place a rubber band around the bottom of the pot, and use your fingers to locate the drainage holes in the bottom. Use a small pair of scissors to cut holes in the paper or plastic wrapping, or cut away the bottom section of the wrapping altogether. Set the plant in a transparent plastic tray lined with a thin layer of pebbles or color-coordinated aquarium gravel; Carefully remove the wrapping, setting aside the ribbon that holds it together. Cut a round from a disposable plastic plate, fit it into the bottom of the wrapping, and top it with a thin layer of pebbles, aquarium gravel, or sand. Place the plant back into the wrapping and resecure the ribbon; Moss-lined baskets usually include a plastic liner to keep water from seeping out onto tabletops or other furniture. This is fine for short-lived forced bulbs, but for more long-lived plants it is best to disassemble the basket, cut out the plastic liner, and dispose of it. If seepage is a problem, set the container on a plate or plant tray; In addition, insert a plastic plate filled with pebbles under the pot to correct the situation when purchased plants include a decorative wrapping that blocks drainage holes. When you're done, you can re-wrap the plant if you like.", "The primary energy force for plants is light, but they also need nutrients that support strong growth. Here are some fertilizer guidelines: 1. As a general rule, fertilize plants whenever they are actively producing new growth, which for most plants is spring to fall, when light levels are high. Plants kept under lights should also be fed in winter, but feeding plants that are resting in weak winter light can do more harm than good. 2. Feed plants when the soil is moist. Plants that have been stressed by dry soil conditions may take up more nutrients than they can use when fertilized before they have a chance to rehydrate roots, leaves, and stems. 3. Withhold fertilizer from newly purchased plants or plants that have been moved to a new place, because the task of adjusting to new conditions is difficult enough without the additional pressure to produce new growth. 4. As a broad general rule, wait at least 6 weeks after repotting plants in fertilizer-enriched soil before you begin feeding them again. Plants usually need no fertilizer for several weeks after they are repotted into potting soil that includes fertilizer. Most potting soils do include a bit of starter fertilizer, and it is best to allow plants time to make use of these nutrients before giving them additional food. Knowing when to begin feeding freshly repotted plants is part of the grower's art, because several factors influence the rate at which the plants use the fertilizer, including light, temperature, frequency of watering, size of the root mass, and overall growth rate of the plant.", "Choosing plant fertilizers. Feeding your plants need not be complicated. A few plants respond best to special fertilizers, but most houseplants are easily fed with a balanced house-plant food, a high-phosphorous houseplant food, or a high-nitrogen foliage plant food; The differences between these three types of fertilizer is based on the fertilizer analysis, which is represented by the three hyphenated numbers on the fertilizer label. These numbers stand for nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. Here is what each nutrient does: 1. NITROGEN, the first number, supports the production of new stems and leaves. Young plants and foliage plants benefit from plenty of nitrogen, which is especially important for foliage plants that are growing rapidly, as many do in spring and early summer. In addition to a high first number in the fertilizer analysis, high-nitrogen houseplant foods usually say something about 'foliage' plants on the label. 2. PHOSPHOROUS, the second number, is essential for all plants, but particularly important for flowering houseplants. Plants are encouraged to produce buds and blossoms by plant food rich in phosphorous. Many (but not all) African violet foods are high in phosphorous. When looking for a high-phosphorous food for blooming houseplants, look for an African violet food in which the middle number (phosphorous) is approximately twice as big as the first one (nitrogen): for example 1-3-2 or 8-14-9. Fertilizers with extremely high middle numbers are often called 'bloom start' fertilizers. These are more appropriate for using outdoors for feeding plants that are growing in open soil than for feeding houseplants. Because their roots are restricted to pots, even house-plants that grow best with a high-phosphorous fertilizer need a bit of balance in their diet. 3. POTASSIUM, the third number, improves the functioning of roots and supports plants' ability to move moisture and nutrients to all of their tissues. In balanced houseplant fertilizers, which are often called all-purpose plant foods, the three numbers are roughly the same, indicating a balance of the three major nutrients. The three most popular balanced houseplant foods show these nutrient analyses on their labels: 8-7-6, 6-5-6, and 20-30-20; other balanced fertilizers show analyses of 7-7-7, 20-20-20, and so forth. As long as the numbers in the analysis are close, the product qualifies as a balanced fertilizer. Most of your houseplants will grow best using this type of fertilizer.", "There is often a big spread in the actual numbers in the same kind of fertilizer. What does this mean? The product with larger numbers (20-30-20) is more concentrated, so less is required. Lower numbers (6-5-6) mean that more drops or granules will be needed per quart of water. Always read a product's label to make sure you are mixing it at the recommended rate. Many plants grow best when fertilizer is mixed with water at half the strength recommended on the label, or sometimes less. The plant profiles provide specific suggestions for fertilizing individual houseplants.", "Understanding micronutrients. As well as nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium, plants need small amounts of other nutrients, often called micronutrients. Micronutrients such as calcium, copper, iron, and magnesium are present in fresh, good-quality potting soils, but plants that are repotted infrequently benefit from plant foods that replenish their micronutrient supply. When buying houseplant fertilizer, try to choose a product that includes at least a short list of micronutrients; Don't discard a plant food because you see no micronutrients listed in the fine print, however. Magnesium can be provided by adding a pinch of Epsom salts to water, or you can mix up a micronutrient buffet by making compost tea. Buy a small amount of bagged compost at any garden center, swirl a gallon of it with 2 gallons/7. 5 liters of water, let it settle for an hour or so, and then pour off the brown 'tea' and use it to water your plants; Alternatively, you can filter the tea through a strainer lined with a paper towel, pour it into a pump spray bottle, and spray it onto plant leaves. Treating plants to compost tea twice a year, in spring and late summer, ensures that plants get all the micronutrients they need, along with naturally occurring enzymes, which often have an invigorating tonic effect on plants; Making compost tea can be messy, but there is an alternative. Look for micronutrient fertilizers that are mixed with water and sprayed onto plant leaves. These are sold at most garden centers (or by mail order). Many of these products are made from dried, powdered seaweed, or kelp. A few are rich sources of iron, which is often needed by azaleas, gardenias, and other plants that grow in acidic soil. If you grow a variety of houseplants, consider adding one of these products to your fertilizer collection.", "A word on fertilizer form. So far we've been discussing the chemical side of fertilizer, but you also have a choice of fertilizer forms - liquid concentrates, powders, crystals, tablets that dissolve in water, spikes that are pushed into the potting soil, or time-release fertilizers, which are coated granules that slowly release nutrients as they dissolve; For most plants, the best choice is a liquid or mix-with-water powder or crystal form, which gives you tight control over how much fertilizer goes into the pot. One is no better than another, though liquids dissolve very quickly, and do not clump or melt when exposed to high humidity as powders and crystals sometimes do. Both liquids and soluble powdered fertilizers are available as organic products, derived from natural materials, or you can use synthetic forms (plants don't seem to be able to tell the difference). Spikes are quite unpredictable, and should be used only when you anticipate a long absence when you must leave your plants in the hands of an inexperienced plant-sitter; Very large, long-lived houseplants such as palms, Norfolk pines, and others that grow into small trees can easily be fed by scratching 1-2 tsp/5 10 ml of coated time-release fertilizer into the top . 5 in/1. 25 cm of soil. You can also use a balanced organic fertilizer, which releases nutrients slowly as it decomposes. With either organic or time-release fertilizer, a small amount of fertilizer dissolves and moves down into the soil each time the plant is watered. Commercial growers use these products extensively, and you will often see a few round yellowish or greenish pellets on the soil's surface of newly purchased plants. It is fine to leave these alone until you repot the plant. When you replace the soil, simply discard them along with the old potting soil in any convenient outdoor bed.", "Plants rarely take up every last bit of fertilizer, particularly in the top 1 in/2. 5 cm or so of soil. In that area, moisture tends to evaporate, leaving behind accumulated salts. Frequently, you can see these salts as whitish deposits on the inner rim of the container, and sometimes on the soil's surface, too. Few plants are immune to the effects of these salts, which destroy root tissues and interfere with a plant's ability to take up nutrients and water. Make a practice of flushing out pots every 4 to 8 weeks. Sometimes called double watering, or drenching, the procedure goes like this: 1. Water plants thoroughly with plenty of clean, tepid water. 2. Allow excess water to drip out through the drainage holes for 30 minutes, then drench the pots again. 3. For plants that are especially sensitive to salts, a third drenching may be helpful. Be sure to pour off all excess water that accumulates in pot trays when you are finished. 4. Resume regular watering and feeding when the soil reaches the appropriate level of dryness for the plant.", "SIGNS OF TOO LITTLE FERTILIZER. Weak new growth, in which new leaves are small and pale, is a classic sign of too little fertilizer. Plants suffering from micronutrient deficiencies often show unusual yellowing of tissues between leaf veins, or pale leaves with darker leaf veins. When starved plants are given one or two feedings with an appropriate plant food, their leaf color usually improves quickly, becoming greener in a matter of days; SIGNS OF TOO MUCH FERTILIZER. Very dark, lush leaves with some browning or curling of leaf edges suggests too much fertilizer. Blooming houseplants may refuse to produce buds when given too much nitrogen.", "Plants give you clear signs when they are receiving just the right amount of plant food. For instance, when older leaves have good color, and new leaves steadily appear, gradually attaining a size that compares with that of the older leaves, you've got the fertilizer routine just about right. Before deciding that a plant is over- or underfed, evaluate other variables such as light, temperature, and proper watering practices. The closer each of these conditions comes to a plant's ideal, the better its prospects for living a long, productive life.", "Most of the diseases that give rise to leaf spots on otherwise healthy leaves are caused by various fungi, and fungi also cause diseases that result in root rot. However, plants that show dark, dirty-looking deposits on their leaves are probably not suffering from a fungal disease. Blackish 'dirt' is usually sooty mold, which grows on the honeydew excreted by sucking insects. You can rule out fungus as the problem if you can wash off the deposits with lukewarm, soapy water. As you clean away the sooty mold, look for its cause, which is likely to be scale, mealybugs, or another insect that sucks plant sap.  See page 268 for more information on these pests", "To keep your houseplants looking their best, take time every 2 to 3 weeks to relieve them of old leaves, while taking stock of their general condition. You might think of these grooming sessions as wellness patrols - the time when you practice good preventive health care while improving the appearance of your plants. You can use your fingertips to pinch off failing leaves from many plants, but a small pair of scissors makes a cleaner cut and avoids any twisting of stems.", "As you remove withered or yellowed leaves, check your plants carefully for evidence of insect pests or diseases. Insect pests often hide on leaf undersides, while leaf spots with circular or halo-type patterns are often caused by fungal disease. When entire branches show signs of pest problems, go ahead and snip them off. Pest-damaged foliage never recovers its vigor, and it does no good when left on the plant. Pick up withered leaves that lie crumpled on the soil's surface as well, because they can harbor diseases and insect pests, too; Never pull on plants when removing withered foliage. Use small pruning shears or sharp scissors instead.", "Most leaves that are shed by plants are not troubled by pests. Shedding leaves is more often the plant's way of letting go of the old and making way for the new. As you aid in this process, the plant benefits from improved air circulation and light exposure, and of course the plant looks better, too. Plants that have shed most of their lower leaves and become unattractive in the process can be staked, prepared for propagation, or possibly discarded.", "Before your green companions' ancestors became houseplants, every one of them enjoyed life outdoors, many in extremely humid jungle environments. On their way to your home, the progeny spent weeks, months, or years in humid greenhouses. Compared to these settings, modern homes and offices are quite arid, especially in winter when heated air becomes extremely dry. When you take a plant that's accustomed to a very humid environment and force it to grow in dry air, it may not be able to adequately replenish moisture lost through its leaves. Leaf tips and edges may become dry and turn brown, or the plant may shed many of its leaves. Plants with thin leaves or those with long, strap-shaped foliage tend to suffer most from low levels of humidity; You always have a choice between altering indoor humidity to meet the needs of plants or changing your plant choices in keeping with prevailing humidity. Several ways of raising indoor humidity are described below, or you can stick with plants that adapt to low humidity, such as cacti and succulents. Another option is to grow plants that need high humidity in a terrarium - a perfect solution to providing a humid place for plants in dry offices, or for enjoying the company of plants if you suffer from numerous allergies. See page 323 for details on planting and caring for a terrarium; In winter, when indoor air is quite dry, group high-humidity-loving plants together on a pebble-lined tray that can be filled halfway with water. To further raise humidity, place glasses or bowls of water among the plants; Humidity means the amount of water vapor present in the air, and it is measured with an instrument called a hygrometer. But you do not need a hygrometer to know some basic things about prevailing humidity. Rooms in which water is often used, such as the bathroom and kitchen, tend to be more humid than other areas of the house. If you keep plants that crave high humidity, try to place them near sources of running water; Plants are constantly taking up moisture through their roots and releasing it through their leaves, so to some extent, they create their own humidity. In a study done at Washington State University, simply adding several plants to a computer lab increased humidity by about 10 percent while reducing the amount of dust floating in the air. However, plants that need high humidity cannot turn a very dry environment into a comfortably humid one without a little help. One very simple strategy for increasing humidity is to place plants close together, because groups of transpiring plants form pockets of humidity on their own. There is some natural symmetry here, in that we tend to fill our brightest indoor spots with closely spaced plants. Placing bowls or glasses of water between plants increases humidity while keeping water handy for dribbling into containers.", "To further increase humidity, you can place plants on watertight trays filled with clean pebbles, which are then covered halfway with water. The water should not be so deep that it reaches the bottoms of the containers, which can cause roots to rot. The trays also need to be rinsed every few weeks to keep them from becoming a secret haven for fungus gnats or other pests. Regular cleaning also limits the amount of salts that accumulate on the pebbles as water evaporates; Misting plants, by spraying them with a fine spray of water, is helpful for plants that need unusually high humidity, but for some plants it can do more harm than good. Plants with hairy leaves, such as African violets, dry very slowly, and leaves that stay damp for long periods of time can develop problems with disease. However, a few plants, such as bromeliads, actually take up moisture through specialized scales on their leaves, so misting them accomplishes two things - the plants absorb moisture, and they enjoy increased humidity; Misting plants from time to time when the air is very dry is a sound practice, but you should not mist heavily without a specific purpose in mind. Do mist plants that are at high risk of developing problems with spider mites, which often follow on the heels of very dry conditions. Keep in mind that misting is not a substitute for a thorough rinse, which is the best preventive measure for this pest. Misting is also helpful in early winter, when humidity levels fall in keeping with an increase in indoor heating, or as a way to ease the adjustment of new plants that are accustomed to greenhouse conditions. Once plants have 2 to 3 weeks to adjust to such changes, it is best to allow humidity to gradually drop to levels that are comfortable for both you and your plants as opposed to continuous heavy misting. Most people and plants are comfortable in rooms where the humidity level ranges between 40 and 50 percent. Running a humidifier in rooms where a number of plants are kept is usually the best solution in buildings with extremely dry indoor air.", "To provide extra humidity for a small, special plant, keep it on a bed of damp pebbles and cover it with a glass cake cover at night. If you keep your plants on lighted shelves, see if you can find a way to fashion plastic flaps that can be let down over the sides at night. Many collectors of fancy-leafed begonias or small ferns use such humidity tents at night to capture humidity within the enclosure. In the daytime, the flaps are raised to admit plenty of fresh air. Such an enclosure need not be made of clear plastic; cloth or roll-type window shades will do just fine.", "Light is the most important variable in growing happy, healthy houseplants. Because we humans run on food, we tend to think that plants depend on fertilizer (as 'food') in a very fundamental way. Certainly they do, but plants derive most of their energy from light. When deprived of light, the availability of nutrients and moisture is meaningless; Plants make use of light through the process known as photosynthesis. Special cells within the leaves, called chloroplasts, take in light and transform it into energy. It is a small stretch to regard all plants as solar collectors. They receive, process, and store up light in the form of leaves, stems, roots, and sometimes flowers; Plants that prefer high light contain numerous chloroplasts, which assemble into thick layers within the leaf tissues. The chloroplast layers within the leaves of low-light plants are comparatively thin. Yet plants can adapt to changing light levels by altering the density and arrangement of their chloroplasts. This happens naturally as light levels change with the seasons, or when available light changes because you move the plant to a lighter or darker location. When exposed to increased light, plants respond by lining up more chloroplasts so they can put to use a more abundant supply of light. When light is decreased, leaves let go of chloroplasts that are no longer needed; A robust Boston fern basks in the reflected light from white walls and furnishings; When deprived of sufficient light, plants naturally stretch toward the closest window; These changes do not happen overnight. Rather, adapting to changing light levels is a gradual process, which brings us to what is called acclimatization. When a plant is moved to a place where light conditions are different from the place it was before, it immediately begins making changes in its chloroplast structures, and other cells get in on the act as well. If the plant is not receiving enough light, it may twist and bend toward the light source in order to reorient its solar collectors (leaves) so they can collect every ray. This process, called phototropism, is also evident when stems lengthen as a plant stretches toward light. Some plants respond more dramatically, by shedding light-starved leaves. Ferns and ficus are famous for their tendency to shed leaves in response to a radical reduction in their light supply; On the other hand, if a plant accustomed to low light conditions is suddenly moved into bright light, its leaves may be so ill-prepared that they wither. Thin layers of chloroplasts are usually housed by thin leaves with meager moisture reserves. Houseplants can be damaged or killed when moved from dim to bright light if they are not given 2 to 4 weeks to adjust to the change - a common challenge when plants are moved outdoors for the summer. Leaves that are scorched by sudden exposure to bright sun seldom recover from the trauma; Keep these processes in mind as you discover or create the ideal light conditions for your plants. Finding the best spot in your house to grow a certain plant is a hunting expedition, but knowing the light preference of the plant, and where such light is likely to be found, simplifies the task. The light preferences of individual plants are given in the plant profiles in Parts 1 and 2. Below we will discuss using natural light from windows and supplementing natural light with various types of artificial fixtures.", "Assessing natural light. Spaces near windows are logical places to grow houseplants. Natural sunlight includes a full spectrum of rays, and of course no electricity is needed to run a window. Large windows admit more light than small ones, but almost any window can accommodate some type of houseplant. Keeping windows clean is an easy way to maximize natural light. It also can help to trim limbs from outdoor trees and shrubs that block light as it enters your windows. If the light from unobstructed, squeaky clean windows proves insufficient, you can easily add supplemental light. Similarly, excessive natural light can be filtered through a sheer curtain, making it more acceptable to both plants and people; Get to know the compass orientation of your windows by watching where the sun rises (east) and where it sets (west). In North America, a southern exposure always offers the strongest light because the sun arcs from east to west from a slightly southern spot in the sky. The arc is lower in winter and higher in summer, so even indoors there is a remarkable seasonal difference in how much light comes through a south-facing window. As a general rule, it is best to reserve space near south windows for high-light plants; In the Northern Hemisphere, the sun's arc is much nearer to the southern horizon in winter, so north windows receive very little light. The sun's arc rises in summer, so all windows receive more light; Similar seasonal trends affect windows on the north side of your house. In summer, north-facing windows may provide enough light to grow low light houseplants, but in winter few plants are satisfied with the weak light in a northern exposure. Yet there are exceptions. Many blooming houseplants need a cool rest in winter, which can coincide with low-light conditions. If you have a room with a northern exposure that can be kept cool, at 55-60°F/13-16°C, it can become a valuable asset by providing space for resting cacti and other plants that need a cool, dry period of semi-dormancy. Should additional light be needed, you can use fluorescent fixtures, which give off very little heat; East windows typically get strong morning sun, while west windows are brightly lit from early afternoon until evening. Even low-light plants enjoy gentle morning sun, so east windows are often preferred places for plants that adapt to low to moderate light. Afternoon sun tends to be somewhat harsh and quite warm, so west windows are often good places for high-light plants that prefer warmer conditions; Natural light from windows is always directional, meaning it comes from one primary direction. Plants respond by turning toward the light, often changing into a lopsided shape. To support good posture in your plants, make a habit of turning them a quarter turn about once a week. Plants grown in oblong boxes or dish gardens can be turned halfway, so that the front and back are given equal opportunities to bask in directional light.", "Increasing interior light. Light from any direction becomes weaker as you move away from the window. Much of this decrease depends on the ability of interior walls to reflect light. White or light-colored walls reflect much more light than dark-colored walls, which are often said to absorb light. In rooms with dark walls, good plant-growing space is limited to 12-24 inches or 30-60 cm from the windowpane, while rooms with light-colored walls can accommodate larger plants, or plants placed more than 24 in/60 cm feet from the window. Mirrors hung so that they reflect light from windows can help illuminate any room; In homes where good plant-growing windows are few, many plant lovers install a bump-out window with shelves in a south- or west-facing window, creating an ideal spot for houseplants. In addition to providing abundant light, such a window has the feel of a small greenhouse, and may help collect solar heat in winter that can be shared with the rest of the room; A plant shelf, in which fluorescent light is maximized by reflective hoods, is a practical way to meet the light needs of a large collection of houseplants.", "Using artificial lights. The ultimate way to increase interior light is to use supplemental lighting, which may work other magic for your home or office. Spotlights used to coax large plants to grow lush and full can be situated for maximum drama, and often make rooms look larger in the process. A shelf bursting with lush foliage that basks beneath a suspended light fixture becomes a refreshing indoor focal point. In your office, perhaps you can use a tall, linear floor lamp outfitted with compact fluorescent bulbs to transform a dull corner into a haven for air-purifying houseplants. When considering supplemental lights intended to benefit your houseplants, expect to be pleasantly surprised by the clean warmth they bring to any room; There are many choices. Regular lightbulbs, called incandescent lights, can help supplement light a little, with two drawbacks. Incandescent lightbulbs give off heat, which may be undesirable for both you and your plants, and the light they provide is incomplete compared to natural light. Incandescent light is often called soft or 'warm' light because it includes more red rays than blue ones. This is why it flatters human complexions. Unfortunately, many houseplants, particularly foliage plants, prefer light with good saturation on the blue-to-green end of the spectrum; Even inexpensive under-counter fluorescent lights are useful for providing light to plants; This is exactly what you get with fluorescent light. Fluorescent light is a little short in red light waves, which is why it seems a bit 'green. ' But compared to incandescent bulbs, fluorescent lights offer a broader light spectrum, the tubes are a bit more durable and give off less heat, and they are more energy efficient. New 'compact fluorescent' bulbs (comprised of narrow, curved tubes) represent a huge advance in energy efficiency, requiring half the electricity of incandescent bulbs to put out the same amount of light. They also last much longer than incandescent bulbs. Compact fluorescent bulbs can be screwed into traditional lamps and light fixtures designed for incandescent bulbs, or they can be purchased as tubes that fit into tube-type light fixtures. In terms of the quality of light they provide, low heat output, energy efficiency, and long service life, compact fluorescent bulbs are well worth their cost, which is slightly higher than that of incandescent or traditional fluorescent bulbs; When using artificial lighting, experiment with the distance between the light source and your plants. High-light plants respond well to having lights only 4-6 inches or 10-15 cm away, while plants that accept medium or low light thrive when the light source is 8-12 inches or 20-30 cm from the topmost leaves. Whenever it is practical, a reflective hood placed over the light helps capture and reflect light that would otherwise be lost to plants. Most light fixtures designed for plants include a hood. When using an under-cabinet type light fixture, painting the mounting surface bright white has the same effect as a reflective hood; Plants that have been struggling to make do with too little light often respond dramatically to supplemental artificial light. Once a fixture proves its worth, you will probably want to put it on a timer, so that the lights are turned on and off at regular times each day. Twelve to fourteen hours of continuous light is best for most houseplants, which also need regular periods of darkness. Some blooming houseplants will not set buds unless they are exposed to 12-plus hours of continuous darkness.", "High-intensity lights. Commercial growers, and some plant collectors, use special fixtures called high-intensity lights to simulate exposure to strong sunshine. Often abbreviated as HID lights ('high-intensity discharge'), these fixtures are costly and may require special wiring to accommodate the draw they make on electric circuitry. They are also not very pretty, and most require a ballast box to boost the power supply going to them. Still, if you develop a passion for cacti or other plants that need very bright light, eventually you may want to invest in HID fixtures; There are two general types - metal halide and high-pressure sodium. Metal halide lights emit strong light at the blue end of the spectrum, so they are often used to encourage leafy growth of young plants. High-pressure sodium lamps do a better job of delivering red wavelengths, which encourage strong flowering. In commercial greenhouses, growers may use metal halide lights when blooming plants are young, and switch to high pressure sodium lights when plants enter their flowering phase; Both types of high-intensity lights are available from companies that provide equipment for hydroponic horticulture, which is the practice of growing plants in nutrient-enriched water that is continuously circulated around the plants' roots.  Increasingly, these companies also offer compact fluorescent fixtures designed for plants, which are quite satisfactory for most houseplants.", "ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE INDICATORS of the changing seasons is day length, which horticulturists call photoperiod, or 'light time. ' Plants that bloom in spring often use lengthening days as an important cue to develop buds and flowers, while those that bloom in fall and winter do so in response to days that are getting shorter and nights that are getting longer. In some plants, the photoperiod is such a strong trigger to flowering that they will not bloom unless they are provided with appropriate photoperiods. This happens naturally when plants are grown outdoors in their native habitats, but indoors you may need to manage the balance of light and darkness to promote strong bloom. For example, several popular, winter-blooming houseplants such as holiday cactus, kalanchoes, and poinsettias bloom when they sense that days are becoming shorter; Rather than providing light to these 'short-day' plants, the key is to deprive them of light daily for 14 continuous hours. You can do this by placing them in a room where no lights are used at night, and covering them with cardboard boxes for an extra few hours each morning or evening. Or place them in a dark closet outfitted with lights and a timer that will turn the lights on for only 8-10 hours a day. Three weeks of this light regimen is usually sufficient to induce flowering in short-day plants.", "Before using any pesticide on a houseplant, carefully read the product's label to make sure it is appropriate for both the pest and the plant. When any houseplant is treated with a pesticide, be sure to keep the plant in a shady place, as pesticides and bright light often combine to cause injury to plant leaves. Use the following lists as general guides; obscure houseplants are often not listed on pesticide labels. If you are unsure about a plant's tolerance of any chemical, apply it to a test leaf and wait 3 days before treating the entire plant.", "What it is: Imidacloprid is the least toxic pesticide that works on contact with insects as well as systemically, by mixing with plant sap. Insects that subsequently feed on plants are poisoned as they take up small amounts of the pesticide; Plants with delicate leaves that may be injured by this or other types of sprays can be treated by soaking the roots with this pesticide, or by repotting into soil that has been amended with imidacloprid. This insecticide is owned by the Bayer company; products containing imidacloprid are widely available under the Bayer brand name. Precautions: Do not apply imidacloprid concentrates indoors, and do not use this pesticide on edible plants such as rosemary or calamondin orange.", "What it is: Insecticidal soaps, as well as homemade soap sprays, kill insects by cutting through their protective coatings, causing them to dry up. The spray must actually coat the insects to be effective. Precautions: Insecticidal soaps are safe to apply indoors, but they can cause leaf injury to some plants. Never use insecticidal soap on newly rooted cuttings, which cannot have the functioning of their sparse leaves compromised in any way. DO NOT USE ON: 1. Begonia 2. Crown of thorns 3. Ferns (not all are sensitive) 4. Jade plant 5.  Palms", "What it is: Neem is a natural pesticide made from a tree that makes pests stop feeding, and also interferes with maturation processes. Neem also deters several fungal diseases. Precautions: It can safely be applied indoors. Products often have neem in their name, or you can check the label for azadirachtin, the active ingredient. PLANTS OFTEN SENSITIVE TO NEEM: 1. African violet 2. Begonia 3. Crown of thorns 4. Ferns (not all are sensitive) 5. Geranium 6. Ivy 7. Jade plant and other succulents 8. Palms 9.  Schefflera", "What it is: Carbaryl (best know as sevin) is a synthetic pesticide that kills a wide range of insects. Precautions: Carbaryl should not be applied indoors. When applied outdoors, it has been known to damage leaves of some plants. PLANTS SENSITIVE TO CARBARYL: 1. Aluminum plant 2. Arrowhead plant 3. English ivy 4. Ferns 5. Peperomia 6.  Schefflera", "What it is: Orthene (acephate) is a synthetic pesticide that is toxic to most insects. Precautions: It can be applied indoors. Still, check the label, because it can cause leaf damage to some plants. PLANTS SENSITIVE TO ORTHENE: 1. African violet 2. Chrysanthemum 3. Ferns 4. Ficus 5. Geranium 6. Nerve plant 7. Palms 8. Piggy-back plant 9. Poinsettia 10. Prayer plant 11.  Shefflera", "Like other plants, houseplants are occasionally bothered by insects. When houseplants are moved outdoors in the summer, a number of insects, including various caterpillars, earwigs, and other critters that are seldom seen indoors, may breakfast on plant leaves or buds. Taking appropriate precautionary steps when bringing plants in following their outdoor summer vacation, as outlined on page 291, will greatly reduce the likelihood that you will see insects on your houseplants; Yet a few insects, including the eight described in detail here, have no trouble colonizing plants that never move from the places you select for them. In alphabetical order, these include aphids, earwigs, fungus gnats, mealybugs, scale, spider mites, thrips, and whiteflies. On page 278 you will find five insecticides that can be safely used to treat insect problems on houseplant; The most common way for any of these insects to gain entry to your home or office is by hitching a ride on new plants, where they may be hidden in crevices, or there may be one or two microscopic eggs attached to the underside of a leaf. For this reason, many people keep new plants separated from others for 3 to 4 weeks, during which time any lurking insect problems have ample time to become apparent. Isolating plants does not mean that you need to keep them in a separate room. A distance of 10 ft/3 m or so is sufficient to keep minor insect populations from moving from one plant to another, because insects seldom seek new host plants when they are satisfied with the one they have; The diversity of species among houseplants also gives you a degree of protection from insect epidemics. The insects described here can infest a number of different plants, but insects vary in their ability to digest the juices of specific plants. For example, if you have a dish garden in which the English ivy becomes infested with spider mites, you may find that dieffenbachia grown only a few inches away remains unaffected. So, when you must take steps to control insects that turn up on a certain species, it is seldom necessary to subject all of your plants to washing or spraying. Do, however, watch neighboring plants closely. If a new outbreak is going to occur on a previously unaffected plant, it will usually do so within a month; In addition to looking for insects, look for what they leave behind, which is tactfully referred to as honeydew. Most insects that infect house-plants suck plant juices, and their excrement is usually this sticky liquid. Leaves that show shiny patches or the presence of a sticky residue on surfaces near plants are evidence of feeding by sucking insects including aphids, mealybugs, scale, and some other species. If the insects have been present on the plant for some time, the honeydew darkens to what is called sooty mold. Both honeydew and sooty mold can be cleaned off with warm, soapy water and a soft cloth, but controlling the insects that created the mess often requires more extensive efforts; Plants that have had more than half of their leaves damaged by insects are often not worth saving. However, if the plant can be propagated from a stem cutting and you find a stem that appears insect free, you can try rooting the cutting as described on page 299. This is often the best way to retain a beloved plant that has been ravaged by insects.", "Description: Where there is one aphid, there are many more, because these tiny sucking insects always appear in groups. They can hitch rides indoors on plants, people, or pets, and because female aphids are born pregnant, they quickly form colonies when they find a suitable host plant. Many plants can host aphids, which are most commonly found on tender young leaf tips, the undersides of new leaves, or the buds of blooming houseplants. Because aphids suck plant juices, infested stems and leaves often are curled or distorted; Most aphids are less than in /. 3 cm long, round or oval in shape, with colors that range from green to yellow to red. Some aphids develop wings, while others do not. When many aphids feed on a plant, they leave behind a sticky residue that makes leaves shiny and often causes gummy specks to form on tabletops and floors beneath infested plants; Aphids are usually found in dense colonies, feeding on tender new growth at stem tips. Pinch off heavily infested stems before trying other control measures. Control: Fortunately, aphids are not difficult to control. The first thing to do is clip off stem tips that are heavily infested. If only a few aphids are present, you can remove them with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol. For more serious infestations on large plants, clean the plants thoroughly in a lukewarm shower or take them outdoors and spray them with a fine spray from the hose. The spray will dislodge many aphids, though some will survive hidden away in leaf crevices. You can get these stowaways by repeating the procedure after a few days. Very small plants can be cleaned by dipping them in a sink of soapy water after first enclosing the container and soil in a tightly wrapped plastic bag. Insecticidal soap kills aphids quickly and easily, so it is a good idea to make a practice of spraying all plants kept outdoors in summer with a dilute soap spray before you bring them indoors in the fall.", "Description: ANOTHER MITE PEST, much smaller than spider mite, sometimes causes leaves and flowers of African violets, begonias, cyclamens, and gloxinias to become dwarfed and distorted. Cyclamen mites are very difficult to see, and extremely hard to control. When new leaves and flowers of any of these plants appear streaked, curled, and distorted, isolate the plant immediately and consider disposing of it. Control: The best way to kill cyclamen mites is to submerge the plant's foliage in 110°F water for 15 minutes - but keep in mind that this sometimes kills the plant as well.", "Description: The pincers found on these prehistoric-looking insects look scary, but they are much too weak to penetrate human skin. There is also no truth to the old superstition that earwigs crawl into sleeping people's ears and eat their brains. It is a fact that earwigs are attracted to the cool dampness on the undersides of flower pots. They are most often seen on plants shifted outdoors in summer, but sometimes earwigs sneak indoors and find safe havens beneath houseplant containers. Earwigs rarely cause serious damage to plants, though they will eat roots and leaves rather than starve to death; A cigar-sized roll of damp newspaper placed next to plants is an easy way to capture earwigs, which are most active at night. Control: Indoor conditions are usually too dry for earwigs, so they do not reproduce indoors. You can gather them with a vacuum cleaner if you don't want to touch them, or you can trap them. Roll a piece of newspaper into a hollow, cigarsized roll held tight with rubber bands, dampen it well, and place it where earwigs have been seen. At night, the earwigs will crawl inside the tube, and you can dispose of it first thing in the morning. Earwigs are also easy to trap in small sticky traps, such as those used to capture ants, roaches, spiders, and other small insects. Sticky traps are widely available at supermarkets and discount stores. Be sure to place them out of the reach of children and small pets.", "Description: When you notice slender, dark gray -⅛ in/. 2-. 4 cm long flies flitting about atop the soil in a houseplant, or when tiny flies congregate in warm windows or near your favorite reading light, you know you have a problem with fungus gnats. Often fungus gnats sneak indoors through open doors or windows and then breed in the damp soil of houseplant containers. Adults may lay 300 eggs at a time, which hatch a week later into tiny, threadlike larvae. The larvae feed on rotting vegetation in the soil as well as on tiny plant roots. After feeding for 2 weeks, they pupate into adults. Plants growing in severely infested soil appear weak, grow poorly, and often shed older leaves. Control: The first thing to try is to allow the soil to dry out between waterings, because fungus gnats need constant moisture. If problems persist, try trapping the adults and larvae. Adults are attracted to yellow sticky traps placed near lights. Attach a piece of yellow plastic or poster board to a wooden skewer or stick, coat it with petroleum jelly, and install it in an infested houseplant placed near a lamp, like a gnat-catching flag. An old remedy for trapping the larvae involves pushing slices of raw potato into the soil, which attract the larvae. Gather the potato pieces and dispose of them every 2 days. As a last resort, repot the plant in fresh soil; Fungus gnats that defy these control measures can be quickly eradicated by drenching the soil with a special strain of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt israelensis), which is sold as Gnatrol. This product is widely used in commercial greenhouses, and it is safe and effective; Make sticky traps for fungus gnats by coating a small piece of yellow plastic or poster board with petroleum jelly.", "Description: Numerous houseplants are subject to attack by these strange sucking insects, which are often brought into homes and offices on infested plants. Mealybugs are experts at hiding in small nooks where leaves join stems, and some species feed on plant roots. Adult mealybugs are ⅛-⅜ in/. 2-. 9 cm across, and look like whitish cottony blobs, which loosely attach themselves to stems, leaves, or roots. They weaken plants by sucking plant juices. The white coating on the adults, nymphs, and eggs protects them from sprays with water or pesticides, so the best way to control them is by hand; Mealybugs are easily removed by hand. Use a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol, which usually kills the uncollected mealybugs. Or, pick them from plant stems and leaves with tweezers. Control: Begin by using a fingernail, toothpick, or cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol or vegetable oil to dislodge and collect all the mealybugs you can find. Pay close attention to the places where leaves are attached to stems, which is a favorite place for mealybugs to hide. Repeat this procedure weekly until the plant is free of mealy-bugs. If the plant tolerates insecticidal soap, a thorough spray will often kill any mealybugs you missed. African violets, cacti, and some other house-plants are attacked by mealybugs that feed on plant roots. Sometimes you can find root-feeding mealybugs on the bottom of the pots, or you can allow the roots to dry a bit and then tap the plant out to inspect its roots. If mealybugs are present, gently repot the plant in clean soil and then take it outdoors and drench the roots (but not the leaves) with an insecticide such as carbaryl. When any type of mealybug problem develops in greenhouses, a natural predator called the mealybug destroyer is often released, and it does a good job of hunting down and killing mealybugs. However, using this small black lady beetle is not practical in homes and offices unless a large collection of plants is seriously infested with the pest.", "Description: Scales are bizarre little insects that attach themselves to plants and suck plant juices. Most species are exclusively female. When males do occur, they do not have mouths, and therefore live but for a short time. Once a juvenile scale attaches itself to a leaf or stem with its needlelike mouthparts, it seldom moves. Instead, it grows larger, exudes a waxy coating that forms a helmetlike shell, and bears hundreds of young, all in one place; Several species of scale infest houseplants, including a few that normally live on outdoor trees and shrubs in mild climates. Others are tropical species that inhabit greenhouses where houseplants are grown commercially. Wherever they come from, scales are formidable houseplant pests. They can infest hundreds of different types of plants, but tend to be most troublesome on ficus and ferns; The evidence of scale infestation is easy to detect. Affected leaves or stems may be weak and slightly yellow, and there is often a sticky substance on the table or floor beneath the plants. This is honeydew excreted by the scale as they feed on plant juices. Most scale are found on stems or leaf undersides, especially near the central leaf vein. They may be brown, gray, or black bumps, which are often shaped like flattened discs. Fully grown adults range from -⅛ in/. 2-. 4 cm in diameter. Juvenile scales, called crawlers, do move about, but they are so small that they are very difficult to see; Use a soft cloth dipped in warm, soapy water to remove scale from leaves and stems. Control: Practice prevention of this pest by thoroughly cleaning any ferns or ficus that spend the summer outdoors before moving them back indoors for the winter. Treating plants with insecticidal soap a week or two before they are brought indoors is an excellent preventive practice. Some ferns are damaged by soap, so test a sample frond before treating the entire plant; Should you discover scale on any houseplant, your first line of defense is to attempt to clean it by hand using a soft cloth dipped in warm, soapy water. Although this is laborious, it is worthwhile if the infestation is light and you value the plant. On cactus and other untouchable plants, use a cotton swab dipped in soapy water or oil to remove scale; After removing as many scales as you can, treat the plants with insecticidal soap, and then place them in a shady place to rest. Another option is to use horticultural oil, which smothers scale insects. Whether you use soap or oil, repeat the application 10 days later to kill scales that may have escaped the first treatment. If you tried to clean away scale by hand and were unsuccessful, you will probably have better luck after you have given the plants a thorough spray with insecticidal soap. You'll find that dead scale are easier to remove than live ones; Several chemical insecticides can be used on scale that persists despite treatment with insecticidal soap or oil and hand cleaning, but be sure to check a sample leaf first to make sure that the plant can tolerate the chemical. Soap sprays cannot be used on palms, so when a large palm becomes infested with scale, a systemic insecticide containing imidacloprid is often the best solution.", "Description: Perhaps the most dreaded pests of houseplants, spider mites are not true insects, but are more closely related to spiders and ticks. Spider mites damage plants by piercing the leaves with needle-sharp mouthparts and then sucking out plant juices. They congregate on the undersides of plant leaves, where they may not be seen until the plant is seriously infested. Mite-laden leaves may show numerous yellow pinpricks, or they may be dry and limp while still green. Left uncontrolled, spider mites can kill their first victim and then spread to other nearby plants; Spider mites cannot hurt people or pets, however, because they are so very tiny. Most adults are only in/. 05 cm long, so you would need a 15× magnifying glass to see them. Under magnification, spider mites may be green, yellow, red, black, or colorless. Without a magnifying glass, you can usually see faint silky webbing on the undersides of badly infested leaves. Also, if you tap or brush the underside of an infested leaf over a white piece of paper, you may be able to see miniscule moving dots. Control: Spider mites usually gain entry to homes and offices on new plants, so it's always a good idea to keep new plants isolated from others for a couple of weeks. In dish gardens, sometimes one plant will have spider mites, but the others will be okay. This is usually because the infested plant was stressed in some way, which left it easy prey for the mites. Weak plants have more problems with spider mites than healthy ones; Early detection is a challenge, but light infestations of spider mites are much easier to treat than severe ones. Spider mites multiply rapidly, with eggs hatching only 3 days after they are laid. A complete life cycle, from egg to egg-laying adult, can pass in only 2 weeks. Very dry conditions encourage spider mites, so they are often seen in winter, when plants struggle in dry, heated rooms. Misting plants regularly or setting them on beds of pebbles that are kept damp helps to prevent problems with spider mites; Early control is crucial with spider mites, which can infest a broad range of houseplants. By the time you see faint webbing on leaf undersides, the mite population is dangerously high; How you control spider mites depends on the size and value of the affected plant, and how much you want to keep it. Small, inexpensive plants that have come into your life casually are best disposed of, because in the time it takes to bring the mites under control they could spread to more significant houseplants. However, if only some parts of the plant are infested, promptly clip them off and dispose of them in a sealed plastic bag. Then treat the remainder of the plant with insecticidal soap or the soap-oil spray described on page 275. Repeat at least twice at 5-day intervals to make sure you kill new mites that hatch from eggs hidden in leaf crevices or beneath bits of webbing; Do not attempt to control spider mites with pesticides. They often do not work, and mites rapidly become resistant to them. If you have a very large collection of houseplants that are affected by spider mites, you might consider releasing beneficial mite predators to bring spider mites under control. This solution is often used in greenhouses, and it is very effective. See Resources on page 337 for companies that sell beneficial mites.", "Description: These tiny, sucking insects are not extremely common on houseplants, but occasionally they manage to proliferate into bothersome populations. Generalized feeders commonly seen on garden flowers, thrips can come indoors on plants, people, and pets. Once confined to your house, they have no choice but to feed on the only food available to them, your houseplants; Thrips are quite tiny, seldom growing to more than 1/16 in /. 16 cm long. Adults look like dark-colored shards or bits of thread, while young thrips are usually yellowish brown. Thrips feed on both leaves and flowers. Leaves that are infested with thrips often show silvery streaks where the thrips rasp into leaf tissue before inserting their strawlike mouthparts to suck plant juices. When an infestation is severe, the leaf may pucker or curl around the thrips, and you often can see sprinklings of black feces, which look like finely ground black pepper. When thrips feed on flowers, the petals show dark spots or blotches; To positively identify thrips, shake the plant over a piece of white paper and look for tiny moving slivers. With a very strong magnifying glass (16x or better), you may be able to see feathery wings on the largest thrips. Control: The easiest way to control thrips is to wash them off plants with a fine spray of water. This is best done outdoors or in the shower, and it's a good idea to rinse the plant again after a few days. Should the problem persist, spray the plant with insecticidal soap. Several widely available pesticides kill thrips, including carbaryl. Sticky traps are also a good option. You can make your own sticky trap by coating a piece of blue cardboard or plastic with petroleum jelly or motor oil and installing it in an infested plant like a little flag. While many other pests are attracted to yellow sticky traps, thrips are drawn to bright blue.", "Description: When you are faced with an infestation of whiteflies, you usually know it, because little gnatlike creatures swarm into the air when you water your plants. These are adult whiteflies, which usually grow to about 1/16 in /. 16 cm long and have four powdery wings. If you then use a magnifying glass to inspect leaf undersides, you may find barely visible eggs, crawlers (larvae), and pupae, all of which are very tiny and yellowish in color. Infested leaves are often pale and drooping from having their juices removed by feeding whiteflies; Whiteflies that infest houseplants can feed on more than 60 species of plants. They may find your plants while the latter are outdoors in the summer, or you may accidentally bring them in when you adopt a new plant. Early intervention is important, because whiteflies reproduce and spread quickly. A complete life cycle can pass in only 40 days. Control: Begin treatment by removing badly infested leaves, which probably will not recover from the feeding done by these sucking insects anyway. Then rinse the plant thoroughly, and follow up with a spray of insecticidal soap if the plant can tolerate soap sprays. Very delicate plants can be sprayed with a mixture of 4 parts water to 3 parts rubbing alcohol. Repeat this treatment every 7 to 10 days to make sure that no whiteflies survive; Whiteflies feed by sucking plant juices, so infested leaves often appear pale or limp; Once you have had whiteflies, it's a good idea to monitor all plants for several months by using yellow sticky traps. Whiteflies are attracted to yellow. You can buy yellow sticky traps made for use with houseplants, or you can make your own by cutting yellow margarine tubs or other yellow plastic containers into 2 in/5 cm pieces, or you can use yellow cardboard. Attach the traps to wood skewers and coat them with motor oil or petroleum jelly. Either of these substances is sticky enough to catch tiny whiteflies. If even a few are detected, inspect all plants thoroughly and immediately take steps to bring them under control.", "1. IN ADDITION TO USING your eyes to inspect plants for insect activity, you can also use your breath. Breathing on plants sometimes causes still insects to move in response to the carbon dioxide in your breath. And, since carbon dioxide is used by plants (they convert it to oxygen), blowing on them gently is a nurturing gesture as well. 2. SOME HOUSEPLANT PESTS can gain entry to your home or office on people or pets. Once inside, they may get lucky and settle in on hospitable plants. Never give them a helping hand by dusting plants with a feather duster, which can be like a rapid-transit system for spider mites or baby mealybugs. Instead, clean dusty plants by hand or spray them off in a shower. Clean plants one at a time, rinsing your cloth or sponge and replacing water in your pail between plants. This is the best way to avoid transferring insects or eggs from one plant to another.", "3. SOAP SPRAYS AND DIPS, or gently wiping leaves with warm, soapy water, is the least toxic way to control most houseplant insects. Soap controls insects by coating them with fatty acids. It has no residual effect, so repeat applications often are needed. Most commercial insect control sprays marketed for use on houseplants are based on soap, or you can use the same insecticidal soap you use to control insects in your vegetable garden; Many people use dishwashing liquid mixed with lukewarm water at the rate of 1 tsp/5 ml per 1 qt/. 946 l of water. While dishwashing liquids may do a good job, they can also pose risks, since they include fragrances, antibacterial agents, and other chemicals that may damage plant leaves. Never use laundry detergent or detergents made for use in dishwashers in homemade plant sprays, because they are much too harsh for plants; A few plants are sensitive to soap. If plants droop a few hours after being sprayed with a soap solution, immediately rinse them off with lukewarm water. Never allow plants that have been sprayed with soap to sit in bright sun. Soap sprays may temporarily interfere with the protective cutin layer on leaf surfaces, making them more susceptible to leaf scorch. 4. PESTICIDES that are placed in the soil and then taken up by plants are called systemic pesticides, because they introduce a toxin into the entire plant system. Insects that feed on treated plants are poisoned as they take in the plant's juices. Systemic pesticides are an effective way to treat scale problems that do not respond to simpler strategies, and they are sometimes used to control other sucking insects, too. However, when you use a systemic pesticide, you are bringing a toxic substance into a closed indoor environment. It is therefore important to read the product's label carefully. Older systemic pesticides often used as their active ingredient disulfoton, which is extremely toxic. Most newer products are based on imidacloprid, which is much less toxic to people, earthworms, and birds. It is included in some potting soils and combination ready-to-use pest control sprays that are safe to use indoors. Read the label, because concentrated forms of imidacloprid-based pesticides should be applied outdoors rather than indoors. Move the plant outdoors for treatment, and allow the spray to dry completely before bringing the plant back inside. Also remember that systemic pesticides should never be used on edible plants. 5. Soap-Oil Treatment gives good control of light to moderate infestations of spider mites. First, give the plants a shower, which will dislodge and remove many of the mites. When spraying the mixture, be sure to thoroughly cover leaf undersides; With small plants, such as African violets, it is often more practical to use this solution as a dip. To do this, fill a sink or roomy bucket with the solution, making sure that the water you use is warm. Wrap the container and soil snugly in a plastic bag, taping the edges around the base of the plant with cellophane tape, in order to keep the soap and oil from getting into the potting soil. Hold the plant by the base and swish it through the solution gently until the entire plant is thoroughly soaked. Shake off the excess, and allow the plant to dry before removing the plastic; INGREDIENTS: I. 1 tablespoon/15 ml dishwashing liquid (do not use laundry detergent or dishwasher detergent) II. 1 tablespoon/15 ml vegetable oil, such as canola or corn oil III. 2 quarts/2l lukewarm water 6. THE DAMAGE TO PLANT LEAVES caused by thrips and spider mites often looks similar, but only spider mites create a webby habitat on leaf undersides. Tap an infested leaf over a piece of white paper to correctly identify these pests. Thrips are dark slivers, while spider mites are tiny moving dots. If spider mites are present, use insecticidal soap only, and do not use chemical pesticides, which can make the problem worse; To confirm the presence of thrips, shake the suspicious leaf or blossom over a piece of white paper, and look for tiny, moving, shard-shaped creatures.", "4.

This procedure is called potting up. When potting up, take care not to move a small plant into a very large container, which can lead to problems with root rot. When a plant is repotted into a container the same size as the one it was growing in before, it is called potting on, or simply repotting.", "When hanlde with houseplants, be cautious of some harmful plants.

Syngonium", "Many houseplants are so easily propagated that they can become your lifelong friends. It is also gratifying to propagate plants to share, and sometimes you may want to launch into a propagation project out of a sense of adventure. When you see roots emerging from stems looking for a place to go, or when you're pruning off stem tips to improve a plant's shape, it is fun to go to the next step and grow a new plant; Understanding the botanical processes behind the transformation from stem or leaf to a nicely rooted new plant makes propagation less mystifying. In the course of normal growth, plants develop specialized cells that become roots, stems, leaves, and flowers. Along with these purposeful cells, plants lay down a safety cache of more versatile cells, which can morph into specialized cells should the plant's welfare be threatened. An excellent example is what happens when you propagate a new plant from the base of an African violet leaf. The base of the leaf stem, or petiole, is stocked with cells capable of developing into roots and leaf buds, and if conditions are right, this is exactly what happens; With all plants, the art of successful propagation involves coaxing these latent cells to action. The individual plant's anatomy will suggest to you the best method to try; these anatomical features and the propagation methods that best suit them are discussed in detail in the following pages. Consult the plant profiles in Parts 1 and 2 as well to learn the best propagation methods for individual species. The six most common methods of propagating houseplants - rooting stem cuttings, rooting petiole leaf cuttings, simple layering, air layering, division, and seeds - are described in detail in the following pages; None of these methods is extremely difficult, though patience is often required. And, although you may occasionally propagate a plant as an emergency measure to save its life, it is always best to get plants into the best possible condition before propagating them. If you want to propagate a plant that has been neglected, give it a few weeks of regular water, fertilizer, and appropriate light before beginning the propagation process; As for timing, there are many exceptions, but spring is usually the best season to undertake propagation projects. Houseplants respond to the long, sunny days of spring and summer by producing new stems and leaves, so plants propagated in spring have the best opportunity to make fast, steady new growth. Propagate flowering houseplants when they are not in bloom, because plants in flowering mode are controlled by hormones that tell the plant to channel its resources toward the production of buds and blossoms, usually at the expense of new foliar growth; MOST HOUSEPLANT GROWERS rarely, if ever, grow new plants from seed, but learning the basics of other means of propagation - especially rooting stem cuttings and division - is often necessary to prolong the lives of beloved plants. There are houseplants that are nearly impossible to propagate at home (for example, Norfolk pine and some palms), but most other houseplants need their keepers to take appropriate action when they become overgrown or are in need of a new mass of roots. Enter into any propagation project with a hopeful attitude and pay attention to small details, and you will probably be successful.", "Most plants that develop leaves attached to linear stems can be propagated by rooting 3-4 inches or 7. 5-10 cm-long cuttings taken from the tips of the stems. You also can root sections of the stem other than the tips. This is often done with plants that develop canelike stems or that have stems liberally endowed with nodes, such as rosemary. Whether you are working with stem tips or stem sections, the places that will develop new roots and leaves are the nodes - the places where the leaves attach to the stems. Nodes contain a good supply of cells that can grow into roots if needed to ensure the plant's survival; The growth of these cells can be stimulated by plant hormones, called auxins, which are readily available in rooting powder. All garden centers sell rooting powder, usually packaged in small plastic jars. Stem cuttings that are set to root must quickly develop roots or they rot, and using rooting powder greatly increases the chances that the former, rather than the latter, will occur. With remarkably willing rooters, such as Swedish ivy, rooting powder is not necessary; Rotting is also less likely if the cuttings are set into a medium that does not support the growth of fungi. Three such mediums are seed-starting mix, which is usually comprised of vermiculite and peat moss; plain perlite; or a half-and-half mixture of peat moss and sand. A few plants prefer one medium over another, but most plants root equally well in any of the three.", "The procedure for stem cuttings is simple, but success is never guaranteed. It's a good idea to stick more cuttings than you need, because some of them may fail when microorganisms enter the cutting. Most plants with soft, fleshy stems root best when the cutting is set to root immediately after being taken from the parent plant, but succulents and semi-succulent plants sometimes root better if the cut surface is allowed to callus for one to several days before it is set to root; After the third week of stem cuttings, take off the plastic cover, but continue to mist the cuttings daily and keep them out of bright light. Remove and dispose of any cuttings that have obviously died (the stems will be black or shriveled). By the third week, you may see signs of new growth in some of the cuttings. If so, move them to a place where they will get a little more light, and begin mixing a small amount of fertilizer into the water used to replenish the moisture in the containers; Most stem cuttings will begin to root in 3 to 4 weeks, but some plants may need 2 months or more before they are ready to be potted into regular potting soil. Use the appearance of new growth as your guide. You can also test for the presence of roots by gently pulling on the cutting. A bit of resistance means that roots have anchored the cutting in the rooting medium. Ideally, stem cuttings set to root in late spring will show obvious new growth by midsummer, at which time they can be transplanted to small containers filled with an appropriate potting soil. Rapidly growing rooted cuttings may need to be repotted again after a few months. The following is the procedure of stem cuttings: 1. Cleanliness counts when handling cuttings. Wash your hands before filling small, clean containers with your medium of choice, dampen the medium well, and use a chop-stick or skewer to make holes for the cuttings. 2. Sterilize a sharp knife or pair of scissors by dipping it in boiling water for several seconds. Allow your cutting instrument to cool before severing a healthy stem just below a node. 3. Remove all but the topmost leaves from the cutting. Dip the cut end in water, then dip it in rooting powder, tap off the excess, and poke it into its prepared hole. (To avoid contaminating the rooting powder in its original container, pour out the amount you'll need into a small saucer or cup, then dispose of any excess. ) 4. Use your fingers to make sure the medium is in good contact with the stem. 5. For the first 2 weeks after setting any type of cuttings to root, enclose them in a plastic bag, container and all, and place them where they will receive no direct sunlight. A plastic bag or other humidity chamber is needed because, until they develop roots, the cuttings have no way to replenish moisture lost through the leaves. A translucent plastic bag held aloft with sticks works great for individual containers, or you can place several containers together in a small box and cover the top with a piece of plastic. 6. Each morning, remove the plastic and lightly mist the cuttings. In warm weather, check them again in the afternoon. Add water to the containers only if the medium appears to be drying out. Try to keep it lightly moist but not extremely wet.", "Cut the cane into pieces that contain at least one node, and plant them on their sides, barely covered with rooting medium. With several plants with canelike stems (for example, dieffenbachia), you can trim the top cluster of leaves and attempt to root it like a stem tip cutting, set 2 inches or 5 cm-long cylinders of cane to root, and also preserve the parent plant, which may develop new stems that emerge from the base of the cane left behind; The latent nodes found on canes often can be coaxed into growing by planting small cane sections on their sides.", "Some plants with very plump leaves that emerge from a central crown are best propagated from individual leaves. These include African violets, peperomias, rex begonias, piggy-back plants, and numerous succulents. The leaf stem, or petiole, is actually the plant part that develops roots. The procedure is similar to that used to root stem tip cuttings. Root several leaves, because not all of them will root successfully;Check the cuttings daily to make sure the rooting medium has not dried out. If necessary, spray the cuttings and rooting medium with lukewarm water to maintain constant light moisture; Petiole leaf cuttings usually root in 3 to 4 weeks. It then takes another month or so for small plantlets to form above the mass of new roots. When a plantlet has more than three leaves, it can be gingerly transplanted to a little pot, and the parent leaf may be snipped away and discarded. From this point on, plantlets will grow a little faster if a small amount of plant food is added to the water used to keep the growing medium moist; Here is the procedure to remove petiole: 1. Choose healthy, medium-sized leaves rather than very large or very small ones. Using a sterilized knife or scissors, trim the petiole if necessary to make it 1-2 inches or 2. 5-5 cm long. There is no need to trim succulent leaves, in which the leaf and petiole are merged into a single structure. However, you may need to let leaves taken from succulents dry overnight before setting them to root. 2. Fill a clean, shallow container with dampened seed-starting mix, perlite, or a half-and-half mixture of peat moss and sand. Plant the prepared leaves diagonally, so the ends of the petioles are buried only about 1/2 inches or 1. 25 cm deep. 3. Enclose the planted cuttings in a loose plastic bag to keep the cutting moist and humid, and place it in a warm place (75-80°F or 24- 27°C). Moderate light is usually best.", "Some plants readily produce roots (known as adventitious roots) at various places on their stems, most often in anticipation of the day when they find their way to a hospitable bit of soil, as might happen in the jungle if the stem were blown sideways in a storm, or perhaps stepped upon by a monkey. Spider plant provides an obvious example, with its habit of developing plantlets at the end of arching stems, each equipped with woody root buds. Other houseplants that have stems long enough to bend over and secure into a pot can reproduce in a similar way if given a little help. The big advantage of simple layering over rooting stem tip cuttings is that the cutting remains attached to the parent plant until roots have begun to grow. If you have tried rooting stem tip cuttings from a plant and failed, simple layering may prove to be a more successful method; Here's how to do it: 1 (Pinch off leaves attached to node). Position a small container filled with dampened rooting medium in a place where a stem can be secured. Ideally, the part of the stem to be layered should be a node 2-3 inches or 5-7. 5 cm down from the stem's tip. Identify the section of stem that will be buried and pinch off any leaves attached to that node. 2 (Secure the stem with a wire pin). Wound the area right around the node by scratching off the outer tissue with your fingernail or by making a tiny cut that goes not quite halfway through the stem. This wound will cue the plant to mobilize into survival mode. Dust the wound lightly with rooting powder and secure it in place with a stone or piece of wire bent into a U. For the next few weeks, keep the buried section of stem lightly moist. 3 (Sever the layered cutting from the parent plant). After 3 weeks or so, you can sever the layered cutting from the parent plant and treat it as you would a rooted stem tip cutting, or allow the layered stem more time to grow roots. If the stem seems lazy at this task of growing roots, a second wounding of the layered stem, 1 inch above the soil, may help it get started.", "Like simple layering, air layering coaxes a stem to develop roots while it is still attached to the parent plant. This method is most appropriate for upright plants, such as schefflera. Air layering is the best method to use when propagating upright plants that have become top-heavy or outgrown their space; In air layering, rooting medium is attached to the plant stem, which is severed and treated like a rooted stem tip cutting after roots have begun to form. Although air layering takes time (usually 4 to 12 weeks), it is often surprisingly successful with tall, leggy plants. With some plants, you can air layer a primary stem, and after it is removed and transplanted to its own container, new secondary stems will emerge farther down the plant; As with other propagation methods, the first step is to identify a place on the plant where latent root cells are likely to be present. Nodes where leaves attach are best, including the scarred areas left behind after old leaves are shed. However, do choose a spot with healthy green tissue over stem areas that have gone woody with age. And, because the stem will eventually be cut away as if it were a stem tip, it's best if there are only a few leaves growing above the air layering site. A scant supply of new roots is incapable of supporting a large number of leaves; Here is the procedure to do this: 1. Once you have selected the place on the stem where you want a new tuft of roots to grow, remove any leaves that are present. 2. Lightly wound the stem with a clean, sharp knife, cutting no more than a third of the way through the stem. 3. Dust the wound lightly with rooting powder and then wrap the wound with a 'bandage' or dressing made from damp sphagnum moss (stringy, unmilled peat moss). 4. Cover it with plastic wrap and tape wrap in place with electrical or fabric bandage tape. You can also use clean potting medium packed into a small plastic bag firmly taped to the stem. 5. With either type of rooting pocket, leave a small opening in the top of the dressing where water can be added. Once the dressing is secure, add a few drips of water every few days to keep the moss or soil lightly moist. 6. Most air-layered plants begin producing roots in about a month, but wait until you see roots forming inside of the plastic to remove the dressing. When new roots are 2 inches or 5 cm long, cut the rooted section from the plant, remove the dressing, pot it up in clean potting soil, and treat it like a newly rooted stem cutting. Slowly increase light and fertilizer as new growth begins to appear. You are well on your way to having a robust new plant.", "Any plant that develops multiple growing crowns can be propagated by dividing the clump into smaller clumps. With most plants, division is a rather straightforward operation, consisting of teasing plants apart with your fingers and then using a clean knife or pruning shears to separate entangled clusters of roots. With others, such as tree philodendron, adjoining crowns are held close by thick, woody roots that must be sawn apart with a small saw or stout serrated knif; Since it is important to injure as few roots as possible, the best way to do this is to submerge the plant in a tub or dishpan filled with lukewarm water, where old potting soil can be gently floated away and roots can be untangled while well lubricated with water. When roots are so tight and tangled that you can't see what you're doing, feeling your way along with the root ball submerged in water makes the job easier; Begin at the outside of the clump, dividing off crowns that are far from the mother clump. If the roots are so tangled or tightly attached that they will not come apart, it's best to grit your teeth and cut through the roots with a sharp serrated knife. As a general rule of thumb, it is best to divide a crowded clump into halves. If desired, the halves can be cut in half again. Pot up the divided clumps, planting them at the same depth that they grew in their original container. Expect to see some shriveling of leaves in the days that follow. Trim off these damaged leaves close to the base, and allow the plant a little time to adjust to its new independence. If the plant does not show good vigor after a couple of months, take it up from the pot so that you can remove bits of decayed roots that were damaged when the plant was divided, then repot; When thick roots make it impossible to pull plants apart, cut through the root mass with a serrated knife; When dividing plants, soaking the roots in a pan of water often makes it easier to separate tangled roots; WHEN PROPAGATING PLANTS with variegated leaves, try division first, because rooted stem cuttings sometimes lose their variegation patterns and never recover them; SOME PLANTS ARE SO SLOW OR DIFFICULT to propagate using traditional methods that they are multiplied as test tube-grown clones. This process, called tissue culture, involves growing a new plant from a few cells placed in a special growing medium. When the tiny plantlets develop roots, they are transplanted to little wedges of soil, called plugs, which are then shipped to greenhouse growers to 'finish. ' The tissue-culture process sometimes affects the shape of the plant, which is more likely to have basal branches than plants propagated by other means.", "Any plant that produces blooms eventually produces seeds, and seeds are the primary way that many houseplants propagate themselves when grown in the wild. However, because of insufficient pollination, seeds produced by indoor-grown plants may not be viable. And if the plants that produced the seeds are hybrids, the plants grown from the seeds will not be of the same quality and vigor of their parents. It is therefore not a good idea to save seeds from your own houseplants. However, you may want to try to grow some houseplants from high-quality purchased seeds; This is usually a very slow process, and the vegetative propagation methods described above are always faster than starting from seed. Still, it can be done. Cacti, African violets, and even palms all can be grown from seed. Most young seedlings require very bright light, so do not attempt to grow plants from seed unless you have a greenhouse or a supplemental light fixture that can be suspended 2 inches or 5 cm from the tops of the plants; The process itself is simple. Fill clean containers with damp seed-starting mix, and sow the seeds so they are covered to three times their diameter. Enclose the planted containers in loose plastic bags to create a moist, humid environment, and watch for the first emergence of tiny green sprouts. As soon as seeds germinate, move the containers to very bright light, and keep the planting medium lightly moist. The first leaves that emerge are often very simply shaped, but these seedling leaves soon give way to 'true' leaves, which resemble those of a mature plant. When seedlings have more than three true leaves, gently transplant them to individual containers; SOME PLANTS COME TO US in crowded clumps that result when greenhouse growers plant several rooted cuttings together in a pot so that it appears lush and full. This is often done with jade plants and holiday cacti, as well as numerous other species. To give the plants room to grow, they must eventually be separated and replanted into individual containers. Follow the directions under Division on page 306 for implementing simple separations. It is best to wait until plants have settled into new surroundings to undertake this project, after which you may need to find new homes for an oversupply of plants.", "You can prune a plant to remove dead or straggly branches, to improve the plant's posture, or to rejuvenate it by forcing it to push out new growth. It is always best to prune when plants are actively growing, though light trimming can be done at any time of year. Most plants that have lost their shape or are holding onto unhealthy branches are candidates for some type of pruning; Before you take up your pruning shears (or scissors, which often work equally well), take a moment to study the natural shape of the plant and how and where it develops new growth. Many plants produce new growth from the tips of stems and branches. The tip of the stem is called the dominant bud. Farther down the stem, there are usually latent buds located at the nodes - the places where leaves are (or once were) attached to the stem. As long as the dominant bud, or growing tip, is intact, it sends chemical signals down the stem that tell the latent buds to remain at rest. When the dominant bud is pruned, this signal is turned off, and latent buds spring to action and begin to grow; When pruning cuts are made just above a node, new stems will emerge from the latent node; Bearing this in mind, try to make your pruning cut 1/8 - 1/4 inches 0. 3-0. 6 cm above a node or other branch junction. To keep a plant bushy and full, prune some branches 'hard', cutting close to the base of the plant, and allow other branches to remain longer. Few plants benefit from a severe crew cut, though very vigorous houseplants such as geraniums and Swedish ivy respond well to aggressive pruning in the spring; Most often, you will be doing light pruning to help plants grow into nicely balanced shapes or to snip off old blossoms from flowering house plants. With many blooming plants, removing flowers as soon as they begin to fade encourages the plants to bloom again. If reblooming is not possible, trimmed plants will usually channel their energy toward the production of new leaves; Some plants, such as Norfolk pine and most palms, cannot be pruned from the top, because they have no secondary buds. With these plants, keeping containers small helps control the size of the plants so pruning is not needed, except to remove unsightly old leaves. When plants become too large, it is best to find them a new home roomy enough to accommodate them; Many people prune plants just before repotting them or prior to giving them a good cleaning. Be careful when watering pruned plants, because they need less water when they have fewer leaves to support. Finish up by cleaning your pruning shears or plant scissors so they will be ready for use when you next need them.", "When houseplants use up the soil and space in their containers, it's time to repot them. Some plants can go years between repottings, while others need to be repotted at least once a year; Check mature plants yearly for signs that they are in need of repotting. At other times, if a plant shows one of the above symptoms, remove it from its container and examine the condition of the roots. When you see mostly roots and very little soil in the bottom half of the pot, repotting is probably in order. If the roots appear to have plenty of room to grow, pop the plant back into its pot and don't bother to repot; The best time to repot any plant is when it is entering its most active season of new growth. For most houseplants this is spring, but some grow year-round, and others grow vigorously in fall or winter and rest in summer. Repotting is messy, so it's great to be able to do it outside in spring, summer, or fall; Sometimes you may have an accidental opportunity to repot a plant out of season - for example, if it gets knocked to the floor or mangled by a pet. It is also not unusual to be surprised by the amount of new growth plants produce when they are kept outside during the summer. When you bring a plant indoors in the fall, you suddenly realize that the plant deserves roomier quarters if it is to prosper during the winter months. When you must repot a plant out of season, disturb the roots as little as possible, because full recovery from the event may be weeks or months away; Plants that have been troubled by disease or poor growing environments are seldom saved by repotting, which is often so stressful that it adds to a plant's demise. Sometimes healthy plants respond to repotting by showing a fast spurt of new vigor, but it is also typical for repotted plants to sulk for a while as they adjust to their new container. Do not be alarmed if a plant sheds a few leaves in the weeks after it is repotted. This is a form of self pruning, as the plant helps itself reach a good balance of roots and leaves. When given good care, repotted plants should recover completely within 2 months.", "LITTLE OR NO NEW GROWTH, which occurs when roots become so crowded there is no room for them to grow, or when the potting medium breaks down so the plant's fine root hairs no longer have the physical structure they need to function properly. When plants are painfully rootbound, they often continue to produce new leaves, but the new leaves are small compared to the older ones.", "ROOTS ARE SNEAKING OUT OF THE POT, either through the drainage holes or by pushing the plant upward, so that it appears to be popping out of the pot. Some plants send anchor roots or aerial roots sprawling outside the container in a futile search for somewhere to go. At the same time, you may notice unusual yellowing of older leaves. While this is normal in some plants, and also can be a symptom of too little fertilizer, it is usually a sign that the plant needs more room around its roots.", "PLANT FREQUENTLY FALLS OVER because it has become top-heavy with foliage. A plant that becomes a chronic toppler can be repotted into a heavy container with a broad base, and perhaps can be secured to a stake as well. If this does not solve the problem, prune the plant or propagate it to reduce its size, and/or start over.", "PLANT IS CHRONICALLY THIRSTY, even when regularly watered. When plants require constant watering, it is usually because the roots are compacted or have outgrown the container. Repotting into a slightly larger pot usually solves this problem.", "SALT DEPOSITS HAVE FORMED inside the rim of the pot and on the surface of the potting medium, which do not disappear when the container is thoroughly flushed. In this case, it is only fair to provide the plant with a root zone that is not contaminated by high levels of salt.", "Step-by-step repotting. If possible, cover a table or other waist-high work surface with newspapers or plastic sheeting. You can repot plants sitting on the ground, but the project will be easier on your back if you can work on a raised work surface. If you have trouble lifting heavy containers, get some help like two-person repotting. No plant is worth a permanent orthopedic injury; Here is the procedure of repotting: 1. Prepare plants to be repotted by thoroughly watering them a day or two ahead of time. Water again just before removing the plant from its old pot, because water acts as a lubricant, which is much needed when roots are tightly bound in the container. 2. Tap the container to loosen the plant. If the plant can be picked up, you can knock the pot sharply against a table edge or other hard surface. With very large pots, it's more practical to tip the pot and knock against the high side with a rubber mallet, knife handle, or other blunt object. Regardless of the pot's size, make repeated blows to all sides of the pot. The idea is to break adhesions that often develop between roots, old potting medium, and the inside surface of the container. Pliable plastic pots can often be smashed slightly to squeeze the plant from its moorings. 3. Lay the plant on its side and see if it will jiggle free without your having to pull hard on the main stem (always a no-no). If it is still stuck tight, use a knife to cut around the inside of the pot, the same way you might loosen a cake from a pan. Next, try to push the plant out from the bottom by poking upward through the drainage holes with a pencil or screwdriver. If it still refuses to budge, your only option is to break the pot. To break a plant out of a clay or ceramic pot, tap pot with a hammer until it shatters (save the pieces to use as drainage material). Thin plastic pots can be cut open with heavy-duty kitchen shears or a utility knife. 4a. Take a good look at what you have. If the roots form a solid mass, see if you can tease out a few that have wrapped into a tight spiral, and shorten them to the dimensions of the pot with a clean knife or pruning shears. This is often best done in a tub of water, or with the help of a hose and a gentle stream of running water. As you work, snip off any roots that appear black or dead, as well as those that unfurl into very long strands. There are exceptions, but most plants can be relieved of a quarter to a third of their roots as they are repotted. Don't worry about cutting the plant off at its knees, because root-pruned plants often rebound dramatically once they have settled into a new supply of fresh, clean potting medium. 4b. Alternatively, instead of trying to untangle the roots of houseplants that develop a dense network of fine, fibrous roots, remove the plant from its pot and stand it on a solid surface. Then use a sharp, serrated knife to slice four 1/2-inch-thick slabs from the sides of the root mass, so that it is trimmed into a cube. Repot into the same size container or a slightly larger one. 5. Place at least 1 inch or 2. 5 cm of fresh, moist potting mix in the bottom of the container, or line the bottom of the container with broken crockery or pebbles. Set the groomed plant in the pot so that it will be planted at the same depth in grew in its previous container. Fill the space between the edge of the root mass and the container with potting mix, and then use a table knife or chopstick to gently press the soil inward toward the plant's roots. 6. Add more soil, and tamp the container on a firm surface to help settle the particles in place. As long as the potting soil is nicely moist when you repot a plant, it is best to wait a few days before giving it a thorough watering. This delay in watering gives wounded roots a chance to wall off their injuries, and signals healthy roots to spread outward in search of water. 7. A few weeks after repotting, check the plant to look for spaces that may have developed between the edge of the pot and the soil by poking your finger into the potting mix. If needed, add a little fill soil to the top of the pot, but be sure to leave at least 0. 5 inch or 1. 25 cm of free space between the top of the potting mix and the rim of the pot.", "REPOTTING VERY LARGE PLANTS is a two-person job. If you have a huge plant that must be repotted, enlist the help of a friend or neighbor to help lift the container, pull the plant out, and hold the plant as you groom its roots. Another alternative is to call in an expert. Many companies that furnish and maintain large plants for businesses can be hired to do the job, or you may be able to take the plant to a friendly neighborhood nurseryman for professional repotting.", "The phrase 'potting soil' is convenient yet misleading, because good potting soil for house-plants contains little, if any, actual soil. Instead, it is a mixture of growing media intended to do all the things soil does, without soil's negative side effects. Like soil, the medium should anchor the plant, provide particles to which tiny root hairs can cling, retain moisture until the plant needs it, yet not stay so wet that fungi and bacteria build up and cause roots to rot; You cannot dig such a substance from your yard. True soil is made up of very small particles that are teeming with microorganisms. In the secret world of outdoor soil, these microorganisms form a dynamic community regulated by changes in temperature, moisture, the movement of earthworms and insects, and the constant inflow and decomposition of various types of organic matter. Conditions in containers kept indoors are much less lively, and if problem-causing microorganisms become established, there is no way for beneficial ones to gain entrance to set things right. This is why houseplants need special potting soil made of materials that naturally suppress soil-borne diseases and that have been further processed to rid them of microbial contaminants. Of equal importance is the texture of potting soil, which is noticeably light and fluffy compared to the soil outside your front door; What is in the bag labeled 'potting soil'? Ingredients vary from one brand to another, but most are blended from peat moss, composted bark or other plant material, and sand or perlite (see pages 315-16). They also may include shiny particles of vermiculite, and most have had their pH fine tuned with lime (ground limestone) to bring it into the normal range. Many also contain small amounts of fertilizer to get plants off to a good start, but don't choose a potting soil based on its fertilizer content. Instead, look for dark color, a spongy texture, and little or no odor. You can easily provide plants with fertilizer on an as-needed basis; These days, potting soils are better than they have ever been, so it is easy to satisfy your plants' need for good soil. The best potting soils are packaged in plastic bags with zipper-type closures, which helps keep them moist while keeping out unwanted microorganisms. After trying several brands, most houseplant growers settle on a favorite. Nationally marketed brands are usually safe bets, but you may get equal satisfaction with a 'value' brand that costs less. If you keep only a few houseplants, a good all-purpose potting soil will probably meet your needs quite nicely. Buy no more than you think you will use in a few months, because opened bags of potting soil can become contaminated with microorganisms while also posing storage problems; Unfortunately, even the best potting soil does not last more than a couple of years after it is put to work in a pot. Organic matter breaks down, minerals are taken up by plants, and the medium's ability to do its job gradually deteriorates. This is why plants need periodic repotting even when they have not outgrown their pots. As for your old, used potting soil, throw it outside in your garden, or if you have no garden, dump it in a bag and give it to someone who does. When potting soil has been used up or worn out by houseplants, it can serve a second tour of duty in outdoor beds, where millions of microorganisms know exactly what to do with the threads of root and holdout tidbits of bark present in tired potting soil.", "Some houseplants prefer or require potting mix that meets their special needs. Details on what to look for in specialty potting mixes for African violets, bromeliads, cacti and succulents, orchids, and palms are discussed in the prefaces to each of these plant groups in Parts 1 and 2. However, it can be interesting and rewarding to create specialty potting mixes yourself by changing the balance of the materials in the mix. You may also need to adjust the content of all-purpose potting mix to help a plant that stays thirsty, hungry, waterlogged, or just plain unhappy despite attentive watering and feeding.", "Harvested from bogs in Canada, Michigan, and a few other places, peat moss is made up of very small fibers that have a remarkable talent for taking up water. Peat moss also suppresses many types of fungi that can cause roots to rot. On its own, peat moss has an acidic pH, so it is a good addition to potting soil intended for use with azaleas, gardenias, and other plants that prefer acidic soil conditions. African violet soils often contain liberal amounts of peat moss (with lime added to offset its acidity) because of its moisture-holding talents. And the fine texture of peat moss makes it a valuable addition to seed-starting mixes, which are excellent for potting up newly rooted cuttings. On the down side, when a peaty soil dries out it can be difficult to remoisten. Before peat moss is packaged for sale or blended into potting soil, it is pulverized into a coarse brown powder. Unmilled peat moss, called sphagnum peat moss, is fibrous and stringy. When adding peat moss to another potting medium, be sure to moisten it first by mixing it with an equal measure of lukewarm water.", "As you run your fingers through moist potting soil, and especially when you repot a plant grown at a nursery, you will probably encounter chunks of bark, bits of sticks, or other pieces of barely recognizable plant material. Although the outside of these tidbits will be black from natural decomposition, they are far from gone, which is good. The coarseness of these hard pieces aids drainage and helps prevent compaction, ensuring that plants enjoy plenty of air around their roots. There are environmental advantages, too. Most composted plant material begins as recycled waste from lumber and food-processing industries; in addition, it may include composted leaves collected from the yard; Nurserymen like using bark-based mediums because of their excellent drainage and low cost. Many plants like them because they break down slowly and mimic soil conditions in crevices between tree branches - the native niche of many bromeliads and orchids. Naturally, specialty potting mixes for these plants include abundant composted bark. In regular potting soil, a very dark black color often indicates the presence of composted plant material.", "Compared to other types of soil particles, grains of sand are quite large, so water flows quickly through soils that include plentiful sand. Coarse sand has long been used to create potting soils that drain quickly. The trade-off is that sand cannot retain moisture well, so a very sandy mix will dry out fast. This is a plus for cacti and other plants that prefer moisture in brief gulps, so sand is often added to soils blended for cacti and succulents. Palms and other plants originating along seashores, such as screw pine (Pandanus), also respond well when grown in a sandy mixture. Indeed, whenever you suspect that a plant is suffering from poor drainage or needs drier root conditions, amending the soil with sand is a good first step. A half-and-half mixture of peat moss and sand also makes a fine medium for rooting stem cuttings. For all uses, be sure to use sand that has been washed to remove salt and other impurities, such as sand packaged for use in aquariums. Sand used in children's sandboxes also may be used, though it's a good idea to give it a quick rinse in a bucket of fresh water before mixing it into potting soil for your plants.", "In place of heavy sand, many potting soil manufacturers improve the drainage of their mixes by adding perlite - the small, white puffs that resemble broken pieces of popcorn. Perlite is made from a naturally occurring volcanic rock that pops when it is quickly heated to 1600°F. The popping process riddles each perlite piece with thousands of tiny air spaces, which makes it possible for perlite to take up and release water very quickly. Perlite is chemically inert, with a neutral pH (7), so it has no chemical influence on soil beyond regulating water and oxygen. When adequate nutrition is provided, plants can grow in 100 percent perlite, and it makes a great medium for rooting cuttings. Many potting soils include perlite, and those created for cacti and succulents often contain an extra helping. Small bags of perlite are widely available at garden centers. Many houseplant growers keep some on hand for rooting cuttings or lightening up soil that seems too heavy for certain plants.", "Like perlite, vermiculite is made from naturally occurring mineral deposits that are mined, crushed, and then heated to the popping point. Vermiculite shares perlite's water-handling talents, so it helps hold soil moisture while improving drainage. Vermiculite mixes very easily with peat moss, and this mixture is the basis for most seed-starting mixes. Always dampen these mixes - or pure vermiculite - when handling it, because some vermiculite contains small amounts of asbestos-like particles, which should not be inhaled. These particles, if present, are not likely to become airborne unless they are quite dry. Using moist vermiculite to root cuttings and start seeds, and mixing it into potting soil to lighten its texture, pose no health risks.", "", "Here is some Soil-Shopping Tips: 1. Look for products labeled as potting soil or potting mix, with houseplants mentioned somewhere on the label. You can pot up container-grown outdoor plants with the same potting mix you use for houseplants. Do not use products labeled as garden soil or topsoil, which are too heavy for houseplants. Exceptions to this rule are noted in the plant profiles, because a few long-lived houseplants benefit from having clean, bagged garden soil added to their growing medium. 2. A few potting mixes contain insecticides that are taken up by plants. These can be an answered prayer if your palm is plagued with scale, but they should not be used to pot up plants with edible parts, such as calamondin orange or rosemary. 3. If you are not sure how much potting mix you need, check the label. Many products have charts on the package to help you compute how much is needed to fill containers of various sizes. When in doubt, buy a little more rather than less. 4. Store leftover potting soil tightly sealed in a cool, dry place. Use packing tape or clothespins to secure the top if the bag does not have a zipper-type closure. 5. If you grow orchids, bromeliads, or other plants that need special potting soil, mail-order the potting medium you need if you cannot find it locally.", "Though all houseplants need water, they are all a little different in this respect. Species vary in how much water they must take up and push to their leaves, and whether they prefer steady or fluctuating moisture levels around their roots. Containers and soils introduce more variables, but the most important factor is the air. It seems reasonable to expect that actively growing houseplants that are enjoying the warm temperatures of summertime would need more water than plants resting their way through winter, but this is not necessarily true. Indoor air in winter is often so dry that some plants need as much water in January as they do in June; The bottom line is that every plant is an individual where watering is concerned. Getting to know the drinking preferences of each of your plants and satisfying them with your watering practices is one of the fundamental satisfactions of growing indoor plants. See the individual plant profiles in Parts 1 and 2 to learn about each of your plant's watering needs.", "The lingo used to describe routine watering practices includes these phrases: 'lightly moist', 'moderately moist', and 'allow to dry out between waterings'. These are general tendencies, open to interpretation by different plants; 1. LIGHTLY MOIST, This first moisture level means that the plant benefits from soil that is never truly wet yet never completely dry. To achieve this result, you simply provide water frequently and take care to distribute it evenly in the container. Many plants that come from forests - both tropical and temperate - like to be kept lightly moist at all times. 2. MODERATELY MOIST, Plants that need moderate moisture often are fast growers with high light requirements. They include most of the indoor plants that produce beautiful flowers and a few robust foliage plants as well. Although somewhat demanding, these plants provide color and drama, and they often go into an annual recovery period of slow growth or dormancy when they need little or no water. The challenge is to provide ample moisture without getting carried away, because even plants that need abundant water can develop root rot or other problems if they are watered too much. 3. ALLOW TO DRY OUT BETWEEN WATERINGS, Many plants with succulent leaves or stems love to exercise their talent for hoarding moisture when water becomes available the same way they might if they were living in a climate where rains were few and far between. These are the plants that benefit from brief periods of dryness, and they often like their wet intervals to be short lived too. But all succulents are not alike in this respect, so it's best to pay attention to your plants' responses to watering and fine-tune your practices to please them. Aloe, for example, seems to thrive on moisture extremes, while holiday cactus likes consistent moisture in summer and drier conditions in fall and winter.", "The most common way to check the moisture level in plant containers is to wiggle your finger into the soil, up to the first knuckle, and decide if the soil feels moist about an inch below the surface. Even professionals use this method, along with other low-tech tricks such as tipping the pot to see if it feels heavy or light. But the finger method has its limitations. You can't tell how much moisture is present deep in the container, and you know nothing about the most difficult area to water, the center of the plant's root mass. To find out how much water is present in those areas, you can use a probe or meter (which are not always reliable) or assess the container's weight; There is always some guesswork involved in plant watering, but the finger method combined with regular weight checks should get you started in the right direction. Of course, the most important thing is to pay attention to your plants. Either underwatering or overwatering can cause a plant to droop, as can incomplete watering, in which only part of the root mass receives moisture. To prevent this problem, learn to water your plants from both the top and the bottom.", "The best way to water most plants is from the top, by slowly pouring water from a bottle or watering can around the plant's crown until water drips out through the drainage holes in the bottom of the container. There is always a possibility that water applied this way will run over the top of the soil, down the insides of the pot, and then out the drainage holes in the bottom. When this happens, the plant's roots may remain much too dry. To avoid this difficulty, poke holes in the soil and root mass using an ice pick or a wooden skewer to create spaces through which water can flow and then percolate into surrounding soil. You should also make plans to repot the plant, since this problem is often a symptom that more root space and a fresh supply of potting soil are needed; Water will percolate more easily to a rootbound plant's interior roots if you make small holes in the soil with a skewer or ice pick; Although time consuming, bottom watering plants is often the best way to be certain that the lowest half of the root ball receives adequate moisture; Another potential problem with top watering are water spots that form on plant leaves, which is a common issue with African violets, gloxinias, and other plants that have downy leaf surfaces. When any of these top-watering complications are present, water plants from the bottom. To do this, pour water into a tray or saucer, set the plant in it, and allow the plant to drink its fill for up to 30 minutes before emptying out any excess water. The biggest risk with bottom watering is waterlogging of roots, which is seldom a problem in small containers but may be if the pot is very large and made of plastic or another material that holds water well. Never leave a pot sitting in standing water for more than 30 minutes; Most plants flourish when they are watered both ways - most often from the top, but occasionally from the bottom. Top watering is easy and practical, and leaf spotting can be minimized by watering in the morning and not soaking the leaves. Occasionally, do go to the trouble of bottom watering your plants. Bottom watering every month or so is an excellent way to avoid the formation of dry pockets in the container, a common problem with plants that are infrequently repotted.", "PALMS, DRACAENAS, TI PLANT (Cordyline), peacock plant (Calathea), and several other house-plants are sensitive to fluoride, which is often added to public water supplies. The most common symptom of fluoride sensitivity is browning leaf tips, which can also be caused by fluctuating soil moisture or erratic fertilization. Where fluoride is suspected as a problem, it can help to place pinches of lime on the surface of the pots every few months. This helps raise the pH of the soil, which makes the fluoride more soluble in water. Flushing pots from time to time is also quite helpful. The ultimate solution is to use distilled water or rainwater to water plants that are sensitive to fluoride.", "One of the facts of modern life is that we often don't know what's in our water. And some of the things we do know about, such as chlorine, are abhorred by plants. Confined to pots, indoor plants have no way to escape tainted water, so it's crucial to give them water that's at least as good as the water you like to drink. If you filter your drinking water, filter the water you give your plants too. If you suspect that your tap water contains too much chlorine for plants, allow the water to sit out overnight, which gives chlorine and other chemicals time to escape as gas. If you make a habit of refilling the containers you use to water your plants each time you finish watering chores, gases will slowly escape and the water will be ready to use by the time your plants need watering again; Some people like to collect rainwater for their plants, an ancient ritual worth repeating whenever it's convenient. Or you can use melted snow, which often contains traces of beneficial micronutrients; Most plants prefer 'soft' water to 'hard' water. Soft water contains very low amounts of calcium and magnesium salts, while hard water, which often flows through deposits of mineral-rich rock, contains high amounts of these elements. Many people who have very hard water utilize water softeners, which remove these mineral salts through filtration, magnetization, or a combination of processes. Water softened in these ways still contains high levels of salt, which leads to problems when it is used to water plants. In place of softened water, use water that is naturally soft, such as rainwater or bottled distilled water for your houseplants; Regardless of its source, make sure water is at room temperature when you give it to your plants. Giving cold water to tropical plants chills their roots, which can cause them to rot.", "If a plant dries out so severely that it collapses, promptly place it in a pail or sink of lukewarm water. It may be so dry that it floats! Use a large spoon or cup to ladle water into the top of the container, and then allow the plant to soak for about 30 minutes. Remove the plant and place it on a rack (such as a dish rack) until all excess water drains away and the base of the container no longer drips. Wait until the next day to decide if any leaves need to be trimmed off. Most plants recover well from drying out for short periods of time. However, repeated trauma can cause stems and leaves to die; This is also a good procedure to try with plants that seem to stay dry even though you water them regularly. Sometimes the middle of a container dries out so much that water applied to the surface runs down the inside of the pot and out through the drainage holes before the roots have a chance to drink their fill. Rehydration can help, but you should also make plans to repot the plant.", "When plant roots sit in excess water too long, they start to rot. As the roots deteriorate, they cannot take up water, so the plant wilts. What seems like the thing to do - providing more water - can actually make things worse! If the container feels heavy yet the plant droops, you probably have a waterlogging crisis. To save the plant, place several thicknesses of newspaper in a pan or basin, lay the pot on its side, and slide out the root ball. Allow the root ball to dry on the newspapers overnight. Use clean sharp scissors to trim off any dark-colored or slimy roots before repotting the plant in a clean container with fresh potting soil. Adding small stones or pieces of a broken clay flowerpot - or even broken china - to the bottom of containers helps prevent this problem; Rescue a waterlogged plant by slipping it out of its pot and laying the root ball on a layer of newspapers to dry overnight; Indeed, overwatering is the leading cause of houseplant death. When you're getting to know a new plant, it is better to err on the dry side than to drown its roots with too much water. In addition, be careful in the autumn. The reason? New growth slows as days become shorter, so plants need less water. And when plants are moved indoors after spending the summer outside, the absence of wind, combined with radically reduced light levels, further limits their need for water. Indoor humidity levels are often moderate in fall, too. When indoor humidity levels drop as the winter heating season begins, you can carefully increase watering until plants appear content.", "There is Five Tips for Better Watering, 1. COMPANIONABLE CONTAINERS, Position plants with similar watering needs together whenever you can. You will be less likely to skip over plants that need frequent watering, and the mess that sometimes results from giving plants a thorough soaking can be limited to one area of your house. 2. OVERHEAD IRRIGATION, To water plants in hard-to-reach hanging planters, use a bulb-type turkey baster or a special watering bottle with an extra-long neck, which you can usually find at a garden center. If you're bothered by drips on floors or furniture, use string, hooks, and an aluminum roasting pan to create a drain tray to hang under the planter for a little while after watering. Or buy some inexpensive shower caps to temporarily enclose the bottoms of freshly watered hanging baskets. 3. HELPFUL HEADSPACE, When potting up indoor plants, always leave at least I-inch of space between the top edge of the container and the top of the soil. This space works like a reservoir when you're watering, giving water a place to sit until it can soak in. It also helps prevent spills of soil or water. 4. HIDE A WATER SUPPLY, If you have only one or two plants in a room that's far from your kitchen (or wherever you keep your watering can or bottle), hide a bottle of water behind the pots so it will always be there, ready to offer a few sips. 5. CLEAN OUT DRAINAGE TRAYS, Many plants benefit from sitting on a bed of damp pebbles, which increases humidity while catching excess water that drains from the pots. As this water evaporates, salts are often left behind on the pebbles. This becomes a problem when plants take up water from the trays, which may be heavily laced with salts. To avoid problems, empty and thoroughly rinse drainage trays, and the pebbles within them, about once a month.", "Just as plant leaves make physical changes to adapt to increasing or decreasing levels of light, stems alter their structure to better cope with movement, which typically comes from wind. As long as plants are kept indoors, they encounter very little moving air. Their stems do not need to be tough, and so they often are comprised of cells arranged in straight patterns. In comparison, plants that are exposed to moving air respond by arranging their stem cells in more twisted patterns, which makes them less prone to bruising and breakage; The transition from tender stems to tougher, wind-resistant stems takes time, so you should acclimate plants to wind that are being moved outdoors the same way you acclimate them to increasing light. Frequently these two goals can be accomplished together. Begin by placing plants in a shady spot that is protected from strong wind and sun, and gradually move them to a more open environment, over a period of 1 to 2 weeks; Even properly acclimated houseplants may suffer wind damage when exposed to high winds outdoors. When very blustery weather is predicted, move houseplants to a protected spot, such as against the outer walls of your house, or simply bring them indoors until calm weather returns. In addition to twisting or breaking stems and leaves, wind can easily topple plants, which can lead to devastating damage; You also can condition your plants indoors by running a gentle fan, which will cause enough air movement to trigger a response from the plants' stems. In winter, you can keep your plants physically fit by talking to them as you water and groom them. The gentle puffs of air from your breath causes slight air movement, too; Beautiful form, flawless texture, and a well-chosen container combine to make a mounding philodendron glow with satisfaction.", "One of the easiest foliage plantsS to grow, Chinese evergreen tolerates low light better than most other houseplants. It features glossy, often variegated leaves that bend outward in an elegant arch. Very small plants, such as those included in dish gardens, will grow in plain water, or in a container filled with clean pebbles or marbles, until you are ready to pot them up. Large aglaonemas can reach 36 in/90 cm in height, but they normally stay much smaller; This plant has long had one weakness: a low tolerance for cold air. But newer cultivars are much less likely to be injured by low temperatures. Newer varieties also form thicker clumps, so mature plants stay bushy rather than growing upright.

The choices you make will reflect your style, your budget, and the mood you want to create. However, before heading out to pick up your favorite plants, think about where to buy them, what to look out for, and the best place to put them. If they're destined for a sunny room, you can dismiss shade-lovers, and vice versa. Also consider space: do you want to decorate a small windowsill or create a large display in a hallway? Whatever your vision, with some prior thought, buying your plants can be a straightforward and pleasurable experience.", "Houseplants are sold in numerous outlets, including supermarkets and department and DIY stores-all are great places to browse. These nontraditional houseplant outlets- which attract people of all ages to impulse-buy for their homes and workplaces-are encouraging a new generation of indoor gardeners. However, when buying for the first time, looking for specific plants, or seeking advice, your first port of call should be a nursery or garden center. Here you'll receive expert guidance and might be able to order a plant of the preferred height and variety. They're also likely to have healthy plants and a good range of pots, potting mixes, fertilizers, tools, and other accessories. When choosing a plant, look for healthy specimens with an even shape. Always make sure that succulents have a good, strong root system before buying them in a store.", "Before committing to buying a plant, look at its overall health and the health of the plants it has been placed with in the store. Check the underside of leaves, where pests most often lurk. Avoid houseplants that have been displayed by a drafty door-they'll soon fail when you get them home. For the same reason, in fall and winter, steer clear of plants that have been displayed outside in the day and moved back indoors at night. Changes in temperature can be fatal. Houseplants vary in their specific requirements, so a shop display in a south-facing window or a dark corner at the back of the shop will cause damage to some plants. The ideal location for a display of different types of houseplants is in filtered sunlight.", "Shopping for plants online or via mail order is particularly useful if you're keen to source a specific plant from a nursery. Many people aren't able to travel to a nursery far away to purchase one or two plants. An added bonus is that buying plants through the mail means you can send a houseplant as a gift direct to the recipient's home. Many online suppliers offer clear images and good descriptions of their houseplants, so it's often a great way for beginners to browse and shop. If this is your preferred method of buying, make sure you're at home when the plants arrive. Leaving them outside on a doorstep, especially during the cold winter months, will be detrimental to their health. Also make sure that anyone receiving a plant as a gift is aware a parcel is on its way. Shopping online is a great way to find more unusual plants.", "The failure of new houseplants can be due to the journey from the store rather than the environment at their final destination. When buying a plant in summer, you can simply walk home with it unwrapped. However, if buying in fall, winter, or spring, take care to protect the plant from the sudden shock of being taken outside and exposed to a considerably lower temperature. Plants such as the poinsettia , bought for Christmas cheer, will soon drop their leaves if subjected to even a brief winter chill. Ask the retailer to wrap the plant, or take wrapping paper with you, to keep it well- protected on the journey home. Request that plants are wrapped by the store in winter.", "Choose plants that have a neat and regular shape with new shoots or leaves forming. Select plants that are in bud rather than full bloom if you want long-lasting flowers. Avoid plants that are either very dry or very wet. Check that succulent plants are firmly rooted and make sure they haven't started to rot at the base.", "Houseplants are dust magnets, but foliage can be refreshed by a regular clean with a soft, damp cloth-a quick wipe should leave it looking its best. A thick layer of dust stops the leaf from absorbing sunlight and reduces the plant's ability to perform photosynthesis (the process by which plants convert energy from sunlight into food for growth). Clean the underside of the leaves too, as this is where pests lurk. Avoid wiping the leaves of plants that have fluffy foliage, such as African violets, as this will damage them. Use a paintbrush to remove dust and potting mix from spiky cacti-it's the perfect tool for this task. It's important to wash your cleaning cloths regularly to prevent the spread of pests and diseases from one plant to another. If you have several plants, you'll need more than one cloth.", "Most plants are affected by pests and diseases at some point. The sooner you spot problems, the easier it is to resolve them.

Discard the plant if you're sure it's a virus.", "Most houseplants require feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer in spring and summer (the typical growing season). Feed plants that are grown purely for their flowers with a high-potash fertilizer to encourage flowering. Orchids, citrus, and cacti must be fed with special fertilizer. Always follow the instructions on the packaging carefully, and never overfeed plants, as this can damage them-if in doubt, err on the side of caution by slightly underfeeding. For easy application, choose a liquid fertilizer that can be diluted in water and watered on your plants with a can. Fertilizer contains three main nutrients-nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium-along with some of the trace elements that plants need. Plant food packaging shows the ratio of these main nutrients: a balanced or general houseplant fertilizer has roughly equal amounts of all three nutrients, whereas special fertilizers contain a dominant ingredient.", "There can be 3 type of fertilizer to feed your houseplants. 1. Balanced Fertilizer, it contain dominant nutrient: Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, it can promote healthy and plentiful foliage; 2.

In addition, you can purchase the relative fertilizer together when purchasing the houseplant.", "For plants to be able to successfully perform photosynthesis-the process by which they produce fuel for growth-their leaves must absorb energy from sunlight. The amount of light they require for good health depends on where they originate-a tropical rainforest or a desert, for example. The north-, south-, east-, and west-facing rooms in a house all have different levels of light and offer different growing opportunities.", "A south-facing room with a large window is the dream for many indoor gardeners. These rooms offer plants the highest temperatures and light levels. With luck, sun will stream in during the day-an ideal setting for plants that come from arid countries. Cacti and succulents-echeverias, for example -thrive in a south-facing room and its heat and light levels encourage flowering. However, plants that prefer shade and high humidity will suffer-their foliage is at risk from being scorched by the sun. Plants can easily dry out in a south- facing room: be vigilant about watering and move them to a shadier spot if you're away for any length of time.", "A west-facing aspect is a happy medium for most plants and the range you can grow here will be wide. The room will be filled with afternoon and evening sunlight, which has far more warmth than the morning sun offered by an east-facing room. West-facing rooms offer a great growing environment- it's almost worth giving any plant a try in this spot, and it's always a safe bet if you're unsure of a plant's needs. This location is ideal for a collection of African violets -they need warmth and brightness to flower but their foliage would be scorched if placed in a south-facing aspect.", "This is the perfect place for plants that prefer filtered sunlight rather than direct sun for most of the day. An east-facing room will receive morning sun and then filtered sunlight in the afternoon. Plants such as the scarlet star, which would naturally grow under the canopy of trees and plants in a tropical forest, will flourish in this location. The variegated or colorful foliage of plants that enjoy filtered light can fade over time in this room due to lack of light in winter. Remedy this by moving them to a south- or west-facing aspect.", "Although these are the darkest rooms in the house, many plants love the shady conditions. In summer, a north-facing room will receive some evening sun, but in winter it will be far darker. Move plants that are reaching for the light to a west-facing aspect in the colder, darker months of the year and return them to the north-facing aspect in summer. The plants that flourish in this shady spot tend to be those with large, dark green foliage. The Chinese evergreen will grow happily here, as will the rubber plant. Be very careful not to overwater plants growing in a shady room, as potting mix will take longer to dry out.", "Description for this disease, Stunted and distorted plant growth, spread of viruses, presence of sticky honeydew excrement; This is caused by, Green, black, or brown sap-sucking aphids on plants stressed by their environment; To resolve this issue, Wipe off if caught early, or spray plants with soap and water solution, or treat with insecticide", "Description for this disease, Stunted and distorted growth, sticky honeydew coating the plant; This is caused by, Sap-sucking insects that resemble fluffy cotton appear on leaf axils and under leaves; some feed on roots; To resolve this issue, Use a cotton ball to remove.

Humidity levels, drafts, temperature, and light (see houseplant(DKGrow)_placing_light), are all key factors in deciding the best place to display your plants.", "A display of houseplants in a hallway is a great welcome, but it can be a challenge to find the right plant for such a tricky area. Hallways are often short of natural light and, with doors constantly opening and closing, are subject to cold drafts and sudden changes of temperature. A draft excluder at the foot of the door can help prevent drafts at night. Choose plants for this area that are robust and able to cope with these fluctuating conditions-the cast iron plant is a good contender. If the temperature in a hallway is low, this could be the perfect place to display seasonal plants such as the paperwhite narcissus, as its white, scented flowers will last longer. A cool hallway is the perfect place for the highly scented paperwhite narcissus.", "Living rooms and bedrooms offer similar opportunities and growing environments for plants. The humidity levels tend to be low to moderate, so choose plants that will thrive in these conditions, such as the kentia palm (see p. 100). If the rooms are small or poorly ventilated, avoid any with overpowering scents, such as hyacinths. Also avoid placing toxic plants or those with spines or sharp edges in children's bedrooms. These are rooms in which people tend to be sedentary, so they're often well heated and the temperature can vary greatly during the day and night. The vast changes in temperature that plants undergo if they're near a heat source can cause sudden leaf drop, so avoid placing them close to radiators in winter. When outside temperatures drop and the heating turns on, it's time to consider moving the plants to a cooler part of the room. Drafts are rarely an issue in these rooms, and the light levels will depend on the size of windows and the aspect of the room (see houseplant(DKGrow)_placing_light).", "Bathrooms generally have high levels of humidity, thanks to the steam from showers and baths. This environment replicates a hot and wet tropical forest and makes a perfect home for many jungle plants such as the bird's nest fern, whose natural habitat is a tropical woodland. Bathrooms are often very small rooms and therefore a popular choice for hanging-basket plants. Many bathrooms have frosted glass windows, which provide plants with filtered rather than direct sunlight. Blinds are also often used for privacy in bathrooms, but it's important to lift these when the room isn't in use so that plants can receive natural light. Bathrooms aren't walkthrough spaces and generally don't have a door leading to the outside, so it's unlikely plants will suffer any of the problems associated with drafts or sudden changes in temperature. Plants that flourish in a high-humidity environment are perfect for a steamy bathroom.", "Keeping a collection of houseplants on the kitchen windowsill makes perfect sense, as they're positioned near the sink for watering and you can study them daily as they start to bloom. Humidity will be high to moderate in a kitchen due to the constant hot water from washing dishes and the steam from cooking. Cymbidiums are popular kitchen plants, as they enjoy moderate humidity and have captivating flowers. Kitchen surfaces can be easily swept clean and washed, so this tends to be the room where plants are potted, cuttings taken, and offsets removed. Unless there's a door to the outside, drafts are seldom a problem in this setting. However, care should be taken when growing plants on a windowsill, as drafts and temperature extremes can be an issue here, particularly if the windows aren't double glazed. Also avoid placing houseplants close to a stove, as this will subject them to dramatic changes of temperature. As with all locations, light levels will be dependent on the style and aspect of the room (see houseplant(DKGrow)_placing_light).", "Protect furniture and carpets by placing a saucer under plant pots. Avoid putting plants close to electric points as this will make watering and misting hazardous. Potted plants can be heavy after watering, so ensure that shelving can take the weight. Place plants where they won't be knocked over by passersby. Never put plants next to open fires or on mantlepieces above them, as their leaves will drop.", "Choosing the right potting mix and container is key to ensuring a strong, healthy plant that's displayed at its very best. Most houseplants will thrive in commercial potting mix, which is lightweight and clean to use. However, some plants, such as cacti and orchids, need a special mix for good results. Containers are also vital to the health of a plant and intrinsic to the overall style and mood being created.", "All plants need good drainage. Soggy, wet soil in a pot with no drainage holes will cause the plant to rot, so unless you're prepared to be very vigilant about watering, grow your plant in a container with drainage holes to allow excess water to drain away. To prevent damaging household goods or causing a slip hazard, place the pot on a drip tray or into a decorative cache pot . You can conceal a pot and drip tray by placing them in a basket to create a jungle look. When choosing pots, consider their weight, especially if they'll be put on shelving or hung from a hook or beam. They'll also be heavier after watering. Lightweight pots are the sensible option for hanging or shelf displays. You can use almost anything as a container, but if it doesn't have drainage holes be careful not to overwater.", "Potting mix is widely available in bags of various sizes. You can just use the original potting mix from the store if you are new to houseplanting. Wherever possible, choose peat-free varieties of the mixes below to avoid contributing to the negative environmental impact of peat.

Break up any lumps in the mix before using it to repot. Vermiculite and perlite are often added to a mix to improve aeration and retain moisture and nutrients. Choose either one, as both these lightweight materials give similar results. Use in a 1:10 mix of vermiculite or perlite and potting mix. If you aren't buying cactus potting mix and want to convert a commerical mix to a more suitable medium for succulents, add fine gravel and perlite into the mix in a 3:2:1 mix of potting mix, gravel, and perlite. Perlite is added to the potting mix to improve aeration and drainage.  A layer of garden-collected moss around carnivorous plants helps humidity", "1. If the potting mix has time-release fertilizer included, don't give your plants additional fertilizer. Store potting mixes in a dry place. Keep potting mix you've made yourself in clearly labeled bags. Some orchids, such as the moth orchid , should be grown in clear pots, in order to observe their root health. You can place a plant in its plastic pot inside a more decorative outer container (also known as an cache pot or sleeve) that doesn't have drainage holes. Always check that your selected cache pot isn't porous before putting it on a carpet or a favorite piece of furniture; 2. Never fill a container to the rim with potting mix. leave about ¾in (2cm) at the top to allow for watering, otherwise, the water will spill out over the sides.", "Houseplants are generally easy to grow but will sometimes suffer due to care and environmental issues, pests, and diseases. The common indicators of an ailing plant are leaf drop, unhealthy-looking foliage, lack of flowers, and spindly growth. Once you've eliminated the possibility that pests or diseases are not the cause of an issue, look carefully at watering, feeding, light levels, drafts, and sudden changes in temperature. Making simple adjustments can often greatly improve a plant's health.", "The conditions in our homes are very different from the native habitat of most houseplants. It's therefore no surprise that some plants will suffer if the room environment is alien to them. If you spot a problem, act quickly to identify a possible cause by researching the plant's requirements. It's quite common for plants to suddenly show signs of stress if the temperature dramatically changes in a room-for example, when you turn on the heating in the fall or light a fire in winter. Before changing the room temperatures or light levels, think about the possible effect on your plants and, if necessary, move them elsewhere. Houseplants also react badly to being knocked or brushed past regularly- avoid damaging their leaves by making sure they have sufficient space.", "in order to flower, some plants need to be pot-bound or to have reached a certain maturity. Lack of flowers can also be due to poor light levels, not enough hours of light, dry air, or overfeeding. If buds form and then drop, this may be caused by dry air, underwatering, a shortage of light, or moving to a different environment.", "Leaf tips can turn brown if they're often knocked by passersby or if the air in the room is too dry. Misting plants will resolve the latter. Cut off brown tips with scissors. If a leaf turns completely brown it may be due to underwatering, too little light, or too much heat. Resolve the issue by discovering the cause and adjusting conditions accordingly.", "The likely cause of this is too much or too little water. If a plant has been left for too long without water, rewet the potting mix quickly by submerging the pot in a bucket of water. When air bubbles stop rising to the surface, the pot is completely wet. Lift the plant out of the bucket and let it drain.", "This is often an issue in winter and early spring, as plants may have suffered from low light levels in winter. In their search for light, they grow tall and thin. Overwatering might have played its part-be vigilant about not overwatering in winter. In spring, repot, prune out any very spindly growth, and start to feed your plant throughout the spring and summer.", "This is the result of shock. Plants dislike sudden changes in light and temperature and will be affected by cold drafts. Gardeners may be tempted to increase watering and feeding when leaves start to drop, but be cautious of this, as overwatering and feeding can lead to further leaf drop. Make sure your plant has the right environment and wait for recovery.", "There are many reasons for this, including overfeeding, over- or underwatering, cold drafts, and red spider mites. All plants lose leaves as part of their natural life cycle, so the odd yellow leaf may not be something to worry about. Lower leaves are often shed, especially on trunk-forming plants such as the Madagascar dragon plant.", "1. If a plant has been kept in a drafty store it's common for it to look unwell until it settles into your home; 2. Discard leaves or flowers that have dropped onto the plant soil, as these can rot and cause problems; 3. Some plants, such as bromeliads , die after flowering, so their demise may be unrelated to care or the room environment.", "It's important to keep houseplants clean and neatly shaped-and not just for their decorative appeal. Thick layers of dust on leaves can hinder photosynthesis and result in poor plant health. Pruning and cleaning your houseplants will also encourage strong, new growth, and ensures that large specimens can be kept to the required size and remain impressive for years to come.", "The aim of pruning is to ensure that the plant has a neat shape and is left with only strong and healthy stems. Removing untidy growth keeps houseplants compact and healthy and also encourages them to be bushier. Pruning off dead and damaged leaves helps to prevent the spread of pests and other plant problems, while removing faded flower stems prompts more blooms to grow. When pruning your plants, always use sharp, clean pruners for woody growth and scissors for cutting off softer leaves. Make your pruning cuts just above a leaf node (a bump in the stem where new growth forms). When cutting off an entire stem, cut as close as possible to the main stem, as no plant looks good covered in little stumps. If removing a leaf from a plant that grows from the base, cut off the leaf at soil level to keep the plant looking tidy.", "Before reaching for the pruners, look at the plant carefully from all angles and turn the pot around. Try to get a clear idea of what it will look like once you've removed certain branches, leaves, or stems, and make sure the overall appearance will be improved by the cuts you intend to make. After each cut, step back and look at the plant again. Always use a pair of sharp scissors or pruners. Blunt cutting tools will leave stems crushed or torn, making the plant untidy and more susceptible to pests and diseases. Wearing gloves is a sensible precaution when pruning, as the sap of some plants will irritate the skin.", "You can give a new lease on life to some houseplants by pruning them drastically. This is often done as a last attempt to keep a plant a bit longer before composting it or because it looks unhealthy or is very leggy. Cut back all the stems hard (to just above soil level) to see if it prompts fresh growth. You can prune indoor plants at any time of the year, but if pruning to rejuvenate them, choose late winter or early spring. Plants that respond well to this treatment include the Madagascar dragon plant and the umbrella tree.", "There are some additional tips about pruning. 1. When pruning, take a step back from the plant from time to time to make sure the overall shape is looking good; 2. Wear gloves and use sharp, clean pruners for pruning the plants; 3. Make sure you give the plant a neat and natural shape when pruning; 4. Deadheading will keep plants tidy and encourage a second flush of flowers; 5. Remove faded flower stems to encourage reflowering; 6. Cut out stems on variegated plants that have reverted to plain green; 7. Prune stems that are causing the plant to look unbalanced and untidy; 8. Cut back lead stems to keep plants to a manageable size; 9. Prune or pull off leaves that are yellow and unhealthy; 10. Cut off brown leaf tips; 11. Avoid spreading pests and diseases from one plant to another by cleaning pruners and scissors with a household disinfectant after use and then drying them off. sharpening tools are available from garden centers and other outlets.", "Over time, healthy plants become pot-bound and require more space to grow. If a pot is packed with roots there's little room for new growth, and it's tricky to water the plant properly. Repotting is usually done in spring. It's a simple process that involves moving the plant to a pot the next size up and refreshing the potting mix. It's not essential to repot every year, but it does improve plant health and vigor. Never plant your houseplant deeper in potting mix than it was in the old pot.", "To make a successful repotting, you can follow the steps below. 1. Check to see if your plant needs repotting-a sure sign is when the roots are growing out of the holes at the bottom of the pot; 2. Water the plant well a few hours before repotting. If the new pot you've selected has been used before, wash it in warm, soapy water; 3. Break up any lumps in the potting mix and add a layer of it to the bottom of the pot (wear gloves if necessary). Carefully remove the plant from its pot and gently tease out the roots. Place the plant in the center of the pot to check that it will sit just below the rim when planted-this will allow room for water; 4. Fill in around the edge of the pot with potting mix and press firmly in place. The plant must never be planted any deeper than it was in its original pot. Water the repotted plant lightly.", "Most plants need repotting annually when very young and then every other year thereafter. Repotting offers the perfect opportunity to remove offsets or divide plants. Before repotting, you will need the following equipments, 1. Pot-bound plant; 2. Pot with drainage holes, one size larger than your plant; 3. Gloves (optional). 4. Wipeable surface; 5. Suitable potting mix; 6. Watering can.", "Large houseplants in big containers, or those trained to grow up walls and trellises, are difficult to repot. Instead of increasing the size of the pot year after year, prune the roots lightly so the plant can return to the same pot. Alternatively, if repotting is tricky and the plant isn't too pot-bound (filling the pot with roots), scrape the potting mix from the top of the pot and replace it with a fresh layer of mix. This can be done very easily every year without disrupting the plant. If large specimens are planted in a container that's narrower at the top than at the bottom, adding fresh top-dressing might be the only option, since it's very difficult to avoid breaking the container when removing the plants. Add fresh potting mix to the top of a pot, but don't fill it higher than before.", "The biggest challenge when repotting a cactus is to avoid getting the tiny spines in your fingers. The easiest way to avoid this is to use a piece of folded newspaper when removing the plant from its pot. An alternative is to wear gardening gloves, but make sure they're a thick leather pair or they won't be spine-proof. Cacti prefer to be kept on the dry side, so they come out of their pots easily. Once out of the container, replant the cactus in a pot that's one size larger and filled with cactus potting mix. Make a hole in the mix and use the newspaper to lower the plant into it. Firm in place wearing gloves. Never plant cacti and other succulents too deeply, as this can lead to rot. Protect your hands when repotting cactus by using newspaper to lift the plant.", "Don't throw away any healthy old potting mix that's left over after repotting your plants. It shouldn't be used again for houseplants, but if you have a garden, spread it on the flower beds or add it to the compost heap to help improve your garden soil. However, potting mix from diseased or pest-infested plants should be thrown away as soon as possible. Old potting mix can be used as mulch in the garden or mixed in to improve your soil.", "When removing pot-bound plants from flexible plastic pots, squeeze the sides of the pot to loosen the root ball and, if possible, push the plant out from the bottom rather than tugging on the foliage; If a plant's roots are growing out of the drainage holes of its container, it's a sure sign that repotting is due. When water is slow to soak into the potting mix, it can be an indication that the container is completely packed with plant roots; Yellowing or wilting leaves are often a warning that a plant is pot-bound; Some plants react well to being slightly pot-bound, as it prompts them to flower.", "Having the right tools and equipment on hand will make caring for your houseplants easier and allow you to take up propagation opportunities without any prior planning. Not all indoor gardeners will require every tool suggested here-your handy tool kit can be tailored to meet your specific needs and won't take up too much room in the house.

These are also very handy indoors if you're growing larger specimen plants that need hard pruning. However, most indoor gardeners will find that a pair of florist or gardening scissors is much more useful. Scissors can be used to remove damaged leaves, trim off brown leaf tips, and deadhead flowers (A sharp pair of pruners is a useful tool for indoor gardeners). A penknife is also an invaluable cutting tool. Plants such as begonias and African violets can be propagated by leaf cuttings and a penknife is essential for this task (A sharp penknife is essential for taking houseplant cuttings). Buying good-quality cutting tools and caring for them will prevent you from having to get replacements. After every use, carefully wipe the blade of the tool with an oily rag to keep it sharp and clean. Store your clean tools safely and well out of the reach of children.

Having the right tools will greatly increase your chances of success in these tasks. The most important thing is to make sure your equipment is spotless in order to prevent spreading plant pests and diseases to vulnerable cuttings or seedlings. Always wash your pots and trays well and wipe down surfaces and cutting tools before starting work. To avoid damaging your kitchen counters or tables, invest in a large watertight tray on which to divide plants and take cuttings. Another essential item is a watering can with a fine rose attached, especially if you're growing from seed, as a fine spray of water is less likely to dislodge or disturb seedlings. Other useful propagation tools are scissors, a penknife, labels to date and name young plants, and a thermometer to ensure you're providing the right temperature. Old jelly jars, filled with water, can be used to strike cuttings. you can use a pair of sharp scissors to cut soft stems for propagation.", "Make life easy for yourself and buy a lightweight watering can for your indoor garden. A can with a top and side handle will make watering and filling up easier. Make sure your can will fit under all the taps in the house to prevent you from having to go up and down stairs with cans of water. A long spout is ideal, as this makes it much simpler to reach containers that are positioned high up or at the back of a display. Choose a can with a detachable rose for watering seedlings; this attachment isn't necessary when watering mature plants.", "Gardeners who want to create a bottle garden should invest in one or two special tools. These are basically mini trowels and forks with long handles. If your hands won't fit in the bottle, you'll need them for planting. Another option is to make your own tools by strapping a short cane to the handle of an old kitchen fork or wooden spoon with tape-this will extend the reach. A paintbrush is a vital tool if you're growing cacti. It's almost impossible to repot these plants without getting potting mix stuck in their spines. A paintbrush is the only sensible and practical way of cleaning them.", "Some houseplants are toxic, prickly, or can cause irritation to the skin, so good gardening gloves are vital to keep your hands safe and clean. Choose a pair that fits well and allows you to feel what you're doing. Thick leather gloves are useful for handling cacti. Bamboo gloves allow great dexterity and are made of a sustainable material. Gloves with a rippled latex palm will give you a good grip when lifting heavy pots. Always check that the gloves you intend to buy are washable.", "The trick to successful watering is to understand the natural habitat of your houseplant and try to mimic it. Over- and underwatering are the most likely causes of failure, so be aware of your plants' requirements. Incorrect feeding can cause harm as well. Some plants require special fertilizers- again, be conscious of their needs. Follow a few simple rules and you'll be rewarded with strong, healthy plants (Watering cans with a long spout are ideal for hanging baskets. Houseplants depend on us for all their needs).", "Every type of houseplant is different: foliage plants soon wilt if they need watering, whereas succulents don't display such obvious signs. It's risky to allow plants to reach the wilting point. as this will have a long-term impact on their health; if badly wilted, they won't revive. Plants from a tropical rainforest are likely to need greater humidity and more regular watering than those originating from a desert habitat. Test whether your plants need watering by pushing your finger about 2in (5cm) into the potting mix. If it's moist, don't water. Lifting pots to feel the weight of a plant is also a good watering indicator. Very light pots mean dry potting mix. In addition, you can push your finger into the potting mix to establish if the plant needs watering (which the soil is not wet or moist).", "All indoor gardeners need a small watering can with a long spout-this will allow you to direct the water to the correct place. Get into the habit of refilling the can and leaving it on a warm windowsill, as houseplants prefer tepid water-but be aware that some plants won't tolerate tap water. If houseplants have become too dry, they may require double watering. To do this, place the plant on a draining board, water well, allow the water to drain, then water and drain again. Never leave your plants standing in a saucer of water-their roots must have air to function properly. Some plants such as bromeliads require water to be poured into their central crown; others, including African violets , will show significant damage on their leaves if their foliage is watered. Succulents are often grown in cactus potting mix, as this encourages good drainage and therefore goes some way in protecting the plant from overwatering.", "Don't leave your houseplants without water while you're away from home. Either ask a trusted neighbor to care for them or invest in watering spikes: these are filled with water and release it gradually into the potting mix. Some gardeners push one end of a thick cotton cord into the potting mix and the other end into a bottle of water. The cord acts as a wick and stops the pot from drying out. Before going away, move your plants out of very bright sunlight and give them a good watering.", "1. Never let your houseplant sit in water-always pour away excess; 2.

Rub them off by hand, dislodge with a spray of water, or spray with insecticide. Hanging a yellow sticky trap nearby can help.", "These limpet-like insects look like brown lumps on the stems and the undersides of leaves. They also excrete a sticky sap, which can lead to sooty mould. If not controlled, your plant will be weakened and the leaves will turn yellow. Rub them off, or spray the affected areas with insecticide (don't spray the leaves of ferns, as they are very sensitive to chemicals). You could also try a biological control. There can be some scale insects clustered along the centre of the leaves.", "These white, slow-moving insects coated in white fluff are found in clusters on stems, in leaf joints, and under leaves. They suck sap and excrete sticky honeydew, which then gets colonized by sooty mould. An infestation can lead to yellowing leaves, leaf fall, and wilting. Wipe off the insects with a damp cloth or cotton bud soaked with insecticide. Alternatively, spray the whole plant with insecticide once a week. You could try a biological control. Mealybugs are hard to eradicate and it is often simpler to throw away severely infested plants.", "Once you get your houseplant home, you'll need to check your plant is in a pot with drainage holes, and find a suitable location for it. Doing these two things will go a long way towards helping you keep it healthy.", "Most houseplants come in plastic pots with drainage holes in the bottom. You can put these inside more ornamental pots. Some plants are sold in ornamental pots with no drainage holes. This makes it difficult to judge whether water is gathering at the bottom of the pot and rotting the roots. It's best to repot these plants into a plastic pot with drainage holes - this could be a plastic pot that you hide within a more attractive one. Check to see if your plant is in a pot with drainage holes at the bottom. If your plant is sold in only an ornamental pot, repot it into a plastic pot with drainage holes before concealing it in an ornamental container.", "Most houseplants enjoy the same conditions we do - warm during the day, and cooler at night. Some plants, such as ivy and cyclamen, prefer lower temperatures. Houseplants do not enjoy significant fluctuations in temperature, so avoid the following places: 1. Near a radiator 2. Near an air-conditioning unit 3. In draughts 4. On a windowsill, behind curtains at night. You could use a thermometer to check room temperature.", "Light is a houseplant's source of energy, and some plants need more light than others. Most houseplants do well in bright, indirect or filtered light, out of direct sunlight. They are usually best placed around 1m (3ft) away from a north-, east-, or west-facing window. Bear in mind that the light can change during the course of the day, and at different times of year.", "Most houseplants need more humidity than is available in the average, centrally heated home, but some rooms, such as bathrooms and kitchens, are more humid than others. To create humidity, fill a tray or dish that is the same width as the plant with pebbles or gravel. Pour in water, keeping the level at just below the top of the pebbles. Then place your plant on top. The water will produce humidity as it evaporates. Alternatively, mist the leaves of your plant using a hand mister. Mist in the morning, so the leaves dry before night. How often your plant needs misting depends on the room. Look for signs that your plant needs humidity, such as brown leaf tips, increasing how often you mist if they occur. Use distilled, filtered, or rainwater if your area has hard water. Grouping plants together will also increase humidity.", "If possible, buy your houseplant from a nursery or garden centre, where it will have been properly cared for. Here are a few things to consider when choosing a houseplant, including how to get it home without killing it!", "Ensure that the plant has a good shape. Look for bushy plants, and avoid those that are leggy or spindly.", "Test the compost to see if it's moist. It shouldn't be soggy or very dry, as these are signs that the plant may not have been watered properly.", "If there are lots of roots visible on top of the compost and underneath the bottom of the pot, the plant is pot-bound (or root-bound). Avoid these plants as they will have been struggling to thrive and so won't be in peak condition.", "When choosing a flowering plant, make sure it has both flowers and buds. Plants with buds will last longer as these buds will open and replace older, fading flowers. Avoid plants with only tightly closed buds, as these may not open when you get the plant home.", "Spring or summer is the best time to buy a houseplant, as the weather is often milder and the plant won't be too shocked by the sudden change in temperature and location. If you are buying a plant in winter when it is cold, be sure to wrap it up when taking it home, as the sudden change in temperature can cause the buds or leaves to fall off some plants, or even kill others. Poinsettias are particularly vulnerable to the cold.", "Check that the leaves are fresh and have a good colour, with no signs of browning or yellowing. Look for signs of pests or diseases, making sure to check the undersides of the leaves (see houseplant(killplants)_diseases, and houseplant(killplants)_pests).", "Sooner or later, your plant's original compost will be exhausted, so your plant will need repotting. Chances are that the plant will have grown, too, so the plant will need potting on into a slightly larger pot.", "Most plants need potting on when their roots are curling around the edge of the compost; carefully remove the root ball to check. When repotting, choose a pot that's only slightly larger than the previous one - an extra 5cm (2in) in diameter is about right. A much larger pot will house too much compost and get waterlogged. Most plants are happy in multi-purpose or indoor plant compost, but some need a specialist mix, such as orchids and cacti. Do not use garden soil. The best time to pot on is spring or summer. Some plants can look a little unhappy shortly after repotting, but they should recover - just continue to care for them as normal. Repot smaller plants into a new, larger pot, with fresh compost. Roots may be coming out of the bottom of the plant pot. It can be hard to take large, mature plants out of their containers, so top dress them instead. Remove the top 5-8cm (2-3in) of compost with a small trowel or spoon (take care not to damage roots) and replace it with fresh.", "Follow the steps to pot on your plant correctly. You will need a new pot and fresh compost. 1. Water your plant the day before you repot it. It will be easier to remove and less likely to be shocked by repotting. 2. Add fresh compost to the base of the new slightly larger pot. 3. Holding your plant upside down around the base of the stems, tap it out of its pot. 4. Sit your plant in the new pot. Leave space between the surface of the compost and the top of the pot. 5. Add compost around the root ball, firming it in gently. 6. Water your plant, allowing any excess to drain away. After repotting your plant, continue to care for it as normal.", "Incorrect watering is the main reason that houseplants die - particularly overwatering. Here are the best methods to water healthy plants and save wilted ones.", "Most plants can be watered from above. If your plant has hairy leaves, however, or the foliage covers the compost, water it from below to avoid splashing the leaves. Orchids can be dipped and drained - it allows their coarse compost to absorb the right amount of water. Water your plants with tepid water so that the water temperature doesn't shock them. It's also worth leaving a bucket outside (if possible) to collect rainwater. Some plants, such as bromeliads, prefer it, as they are sensitive to the chemicals in hard tap water. For most plants, use a thin, long-necked watering can so that the spout can reach the compost easily. Water around the base of the plant so that the compost is evenly moist, and allow the excess water to drain away. Use this method to avoid splashing the leaves, which will create ugly marks and lead to the leaves rotting. Stand the pot in a saucer of water for around 30 minutes. Drain any excess water from the saucer. A good technique for watering orchids - place the pot in a container of tepid water and leave it to stand for around 10 minutes. Let it drain thoroughly.", "Here are some things to consider when working out whether your plant needs watering, and how much water to give it. Overwatering is the number one cause of houseplant death. But be sure not to underwater either. Don't water to a timetable - get to know your plant's needs instead. Most plants only need watering when the top 1-2cm (1/2-3/4in) of compost is dry - gently poke your finger into the soil to test it. If a rosette of leaves is covering the compost, go by the weight of the pot - a very light pot will have dry compost. Aim to make the compost moist, but not wet. Most houseplants hate sitting in soggy compost, so always let excess water drain away. Compost in terracotta pots dries out more quickly than that in plastic or ceramic pots, this is because terracotta is a porous material. Most plants need less water in winter as they are not actively growing. Some plants need this period of winter rest to reflower.", "If your plant has wilted, it may be due to a lack of water. Check that the compost is dry to ensure that your plant has been underwatered, as overwatering can have the same effect. Move your plant somewhere shady and fill a bowl with tepid water. In just its plastic pot with drainage holes, dunk your plant into the water, weighing it down if it floats. Soak for around 30 minutes and drain. The plant should revive within an hour.", "Plants can also wilt due to waterlogging. This is much more serious as it can kill your plant more quickly than underwatering. Remove your plant from its pot(s) and wrap the root ball with newspaper or paper towels, replacing them until they have soaked up all the moisture.

Remember, even organic remedies can be toxic to people and pets, so be sure to read and follow all product labels carefully. Diseases on plants are harder to deal with than either adverse cultural conditions or pests. The good news is-diseases are much rarer. If it is a disease, 80% of the time it is caused by a fungus; There is no cure for bacterial or virus infections on plants, so prevention is, as always, the most effective thing you can do. Buy plants from a reliable source and always inspect plants before you buy them. Keep new plants in another room away from all your other houseplants for 14 days; use the same strategy to isolate sick plants. Do not overwater and make sure your plant is in the right-sized pot. Sanitize by removing any infected plant parts swiftly; throw infected plant tissue in the garbage, not your compost pile. Sadly, with all virus infections and rot diseases, you may have no other option but to get rid of the infected plant.", "Anthurium blight: This disease is caused by a lethal bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas campestris pv. dieffenbachiae. The earliest symptom is the appearance of water-soaked spots on the leaves. Then the spots dry out, turn reddish brown, and develop yellow haloes. When the spots enlarge and invade leaf veins, the disease becomes systemic and life-threatening to your plant. It may be found on any aroid (see sidebar) but commonly infects Chinese evergreen, dumb cane, and flamingo flower. Sanitize by remov ing infected plant parts, sterilize your tools, and keep the foliage dry.", "Bacterial Leaf Spot: Spots that have discrete, rounded edges appear on leaves. At first they are translucent, like grease spots on paper. As they increase in size they become angular because the infection is confined by leaf veins. This disease can infect any houseplant but is most common on staghorn ferns and lady's slipper orchids. Sanitize by removing infected plant parts, sterilize your tools, and keep the foliage dry.", "Cymbidium Mosaic Virus: This virus infection is systemic and can occur on any orchid, not just cymbidiums. It rarely kills plants but can disfigure them. Symptoms are variable and include tiny yellowish, whitish, or brown, irregular-shaped spots that enlarge. These spots are sometimes sunken, sometimes not. Unfortunately, an orchid can be infected and have no symptoms at all. Because it is systemic, all parts of the plant-leaves, stems, roots, flowers-carry the disease. Pruners, knives, and scissors carry the virus from plant to plant. Interestingly, this virus has never been found in the wild. It exists only in cultivated orchids and is found in collections worldwide. An ELISA (Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay) test positively identifies any infected orchid, but kits are expensive and the sample you take must be sent to a lab; Isolate sick plants or quarantine new plants for 14 days. A symptomless but infected orchid can easily infect all your other orchids if you fail to sterilize your tools. If possible, clone your orchid to grow a new specimen that is free of the virus.", "Gray Mold: Gray mold is an infection caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea, a pathogen with a very wide range of victims from houseplants to wine grapes. It starts out as wet, brown spots on leaves or flowers. The plant tissue seems to melt and eventually becomes covered with gray-brown fuzz. That fuzz is composed of millions of spores that float in the air to start new infections on healthy plants. Nip this disease in the bud by removing any infected plant parts swiftly. To prevent new infections, use baking soda spray or spray with a bacterial fungicide (Bacillus subtilis).", "Leaf Gall: Leaf gall is a fungus disease caused by the pathogen Exobasidium vaccinii. Among houseplants this fungus infects only florist azalea. In the garden it also infects blueberries, huckleberries, and cranberries, which can transmit the disease to your azalea. Infections occur on leaves and sometimes on flowers and stems; The infected tissue becomes greatly swollen, inflated, and pale green to white, pink, or pale brown. This disease is airborne and spreads via spores. Remove any infected plant parts swiftly. To prevent new infections, use baking soda spray or spray with a bacterial fungicide (Bacillus subtilis).", "Leaf Spot Fungus: Small (pinprick- to matchhead-sized) brown or black spots that look a bit like freckles develop on the leaves. Often, but not always, the leaf begins to turn yellow where the spots are located, and/or the spots may develop yellow haloes. The spots are sometimes surrounded by a narrow purple band. The spots are almost always round, not angular, because these fungi are capable of eating their way through the veins of the leaf. As time goes by, the spots get larger and the leaf becomes more yellow. These symptoms are caused by one of several different fungal pathogens that infect the foliage of houseplants. All produce spores that drift through the air to land on healthy leaves. The spores germinate and the fungus attacks your plant. These leaf spot fungi disfigure your plants and they spread to other plants, but they are only lethal when plants are already weak. Remove any infected plant parts swiftly. To prevent new infections, use baking soda spray or spray with a bacterial fungicide (Bacillus subtilis).", "Mosaic Virus: Mosaic viruses are a very large group that includes tobacco mosaic virus, cucumber mosaic virus, common bean mosaic virus, and many others. Most of these viruses were named for the plant they were first discovered on, for example, tobacco mosaic or TMV. It does not mean that TMV infects only tobacco and nothing else. In fact, TMV is worldwide and infects more than 150 different kinds of plants, including some houseplants. The symptoms of a mosaic virus are irregular zig-zag yellow streaks and patches of yellow mottles or specks on otherwise green leaves. Like the orchid viruses, plants can be infected with a mosaic virus and remain symptomless. Mosaic viruses are systemic and are transmitted from plant to plant by pruners and scissors. Be sure to sterilize tools. Isolate sick plants or quarantine new plants for 14 days. If possible, clone your plant to grow a new specimen that is free of the virus.", "Ringspot Virus: This systemic virus infection can occur on any plant but is most common on orchids. It rarely kills plants but does disfigure them. Symptoms are variable and include spots on leaves and off-color streaks on the flower petals. The leaf spots are often concentric yellow rings with brown centers. Unfortunately, a plant can be infected and have no symptoms at all. Still worse, a symptomless but infected plant can easily infect all your other plants if you fail to sterilize your pruners. Because it is systemic, all parts of the plant-leaves, stems, roots, flowers-carry the disease. Pruners, knives, and scissors carry the virus from plant to plant.

If possible, clone your orchid to grow a new specimen that is free of the virus.", "Powdery Mildew: Symptoms of this fungus include grayish white patches growing on the leaves, stems, and flowers. Your plant looks like it's been dusted with flour that rubs off easily. Leaves eventually develop dead, brown patches and become deformed. Powdery mildew is a disease caused by a number of different pathogenic fungi. All these different fungi have white mycelium that grows on the surface of the leaves and all produce airborne spores. Remove any infected plant parts swiftly. To prevent new infections, use baking soda spray or spray with a bacterial fungicide (Bacillus subtilis).", "Root Rot: If your plant has wilted even though the potting medium is wet, pull the plant out of its pot. If the roots are gray, dark brown, or black rather than whitish, and mushy rather than firm, your plant has root rot. Root rot is an insidious but preventable disease that can kill your plant before you even know that something is wrong. It's a soilborne fungus disease caused by a number of different pathogenic fungi. Some of these fungi are opportunistic pathogens that are able to invade the root system only after the roots have been broken or cut, or drowned by overwatering. Some are aggressive enough to invade a perfectly healthy root system. All thrive in soggy, waterlogged soil and most disperse their spores in water, not air. In most cases prevention is the only cure for root rot. If your plant is very valuable and long-lived you might try to save it, but the prognosis is poor. Remove diseased root tissue, and then: discard potting medium, sterilize the pot and all tools, and spray the roots with Actinovate, an organic fungicide. To prevent new infections, do not overwater and make sure plants are in the right-sized pot, i. e. , that the pot is not too big.", "Rust Fungus: If your plant develops spots on the upper surface of its leaves, flip an affected leaf over and look at the underside. If there are raised bumps on the undersurface right below each of the spots on the upper surface, and if the raised bumps have colorful, powdery spores, then your plant has one of the many rust fungi. The approximately 5,000 species of rust fungus are host-specific-that is, the rust fungus that infects your flowering maple is not the same one that infects your snapdragons. The spores are airborne and usually rusty red in color. Remove any infected plant parts swiftly. To prevent new infections, spray with a bacterial fungicide (Bacillus subtilis) or sulfur.", "Soft Rot: Fleshy stems, including rhizomes, develop mushy, rotted areas that ooze slime and often smell bad. This is caused by the bacterial pathogen Erwinia carotovora. This is a life-threatening disease that kills plants, but the prognosis is not as grim as it is for root rot. Remove infected plant parts. Remove the plant and discard infected potting medium. Sterilize the container and all your tools. Repot the plant in fresh medium.", "Steam Rot: The stem of your plant turns brown or black at the soil line and becomes soft and mushy. It does not smell bad and doesn't ooze slime. The plant's roots may also become infected. This is a serious, life-threatening disease, caused by some of the same fungi that cause root rot. The disease is preventable with proper watering, but a cure is doubtful and the prognosis poor. Remove infected plant parts. Remove the plant and discard infected potting medium.

Leaves that are stuck together cannot free themselves, but they keep trying to grow. As a result, the leaf becomes pleated and folded. Accordion-folded leaves will not outgrow this condition. Although unsightly, it is not life-threatening to your plant. Correct the growing conditions, and subsequent leaves will grow normally; If low humidity is the trouble, raise it by misting your orchids with a spray bottle of water on a mist setting, or use a handheld mister. To determine how often to mist, look at the humidity needs of your plant in its plant portrait. Set your orchid in a saucer or tray of water with the pot sitting on pot feet or pebbles to raise it up above the water. Group your houseplants together to raise the humidity. Put a humidifier in the room. Avoid blasts of hot air from heat registers; If you believe the humidity is adequate, then insufficient water may be the trouble. Water your orchids more frequently, especially if the air in your home is unusually warm and dry. If humidity is adequate and your frequency of watering is appropriate, check to see if your orchid needs to be up-potted and the potting medium refreshed.", "Brown leaf tips. The tips of the leaves die and turn brown. The cause is low humidity and/or insufficient water. As this condition progresses, leaf edges may also turn brown and die. If tiny black dots develop in the dead brown areas, your plant has a leaf spot fungus infection; If low humidity is the trouble, raise it by misting your houseplants with a spray bottle of water on a mist setting, or use a handheld mister. To determine how often to mist, look at the humidity needs of your plant in its plant portrait. Set your plant in a saucer or tray of water with the pot sitting on pot feet or pebbles to raise it up above the water. Group your houseplants together to raise the humidity. Put a humidifier in the room. Avoid blasts of hot air from heat registers; For insufficient water, check to see if your plant's pot is too small for it. If so, your plant needs to be up-potted. Make sure that you provide your plant with all the water it needs.", "Oedema. Plants develop tiny brown bumps on the leaves. These bumps are firmly attached and cannot be rubbed off with your thumbnail. The bumps are rough to the touch, because they're composed of cork tissue that the leaves produce in response to overwatering. Oedema is not a disease or a pest, and is not life-threatening, but leaves that have already developed edema are going to stay that way. To prevent edema from occurring on new leaves, reduce the frequency and quantity of watering. Increase light and temperature to allow more rapid transpira tion. Make sure the potting medium drains adequately and that your plant is not suffering from soggy soil.", "Failure to flower: Sometimes houseplants that should produce flowers don't. There are several reasons why a plant fails to flower but the most common are lack of chilling, insufficient light, and lack of long nights. Each of these factors applies to specific houseplants, as follows; Lack of chilling: amaryllis, Easter cactus, florist azalea, jasmine, kalanchoe, orchid cactus, and spring bulbs all require a cold treatment in order to set flower buds. The details for each plant's required cold treatment (when, for how long, at what temperature) are given in the plant portraits; Insufficient light: dendrobium, hibiscus, prickly pear, rat tail cactus, tiger jaws, and wax plant all require sufficient levels of light (whether high or, in the case of wax plant, medium) to have enough energy to produce flowers. Plants that fail to flower because they don't receive enough sun need to be moved to a higher light situation. Alternatively, when curtains are responsible for low light intensity, they can be left open or removed. Increase sunlight carefully and acclimate your plants slowly to avoid sunburn; Lack of long nights: Christmas cactus, jasmine, orchid cactus, and poinsettia all require a period of darkness in order to set flower buds. See their plant portraits for details of when and how to provide these long nights, and the duration of this blackout treatment. When you bring your plant out into daylight make sure it cannot 'see' light sources at night such as streetlamps, headlights, or electric lighting in your home.", "Flower bud drop: Many houseplants drop their flower buds. Gardenia is notoriously finicky and tosses its flower buds on the ground for a variety of reasons. Usually it's because of its requirement for acid soil. Make sure the organic fertilizer you use is designed for acid-loving plants. Gardenias also love coffee grounds, as their portrait notes. If you are certain the soil pH is correct, yet your gardenia (or any other houseplant) still drops its buds, then check to make sure it isn't too cold and that it's getting enough light. For all houseplants, be sure you're not overwatering, as this is a frequent cause of bud drop. Many orchids also drop their flower buds, but the cause is unknown.", "Leaf drop: Leaves of all plants have a finite lifespan. As a rule plants shed their oldest leaves a few at a time. This is totally normal and not cause for concern. However, when plants drop a lot of leaves all at once, this is not normal. Many plants drop their leaves if overwatered. Have another look at the plant portrait to check the plant's water needs; False aralia, weeping fig, and others drop their leaves if you move them to a new location. Put them in a permanent location and leave them there. Do not put them outdoors for the summer; Boston fern, hare's foot fern, and jade plant, among others, tend to be drought deciduous and drop their leaves if they get too dry. Recheck the plant portraits for their water needs; Donkey tail and lipstick plant are just two plants that drop their leaves if they get too cold. Consult the plant portraits to determine the correct temperature range.", "Leaves changing color:Plants with colorful or variegated foliage sometimes begin to lose their bright yellows, whites, reds, or pinks. Leaves can revert to plain green, or just fade and turn pale. Too much or too little sunlight causes the foliage of certain plants to change color; Arrowhead plant, coleus, and Swedish ivy are all examples of plants with colorful foliage that fades and loses vibrancy with too much sunlight. Move these plants to a lower light situation. Or, instead of moving your plant, add more curtains to reduce light intensity; Chinese evergreen, croton, polka dot plant, pothos, and variegated cultivars of cast-iron plant and ivy are all examples of plants with colorful, variegated leaves that tend to turn plain green with too little sunlight. Move these plants to a higher light situation. Or, instead of moving your plant, remove some of the curtains on your windows. Acclimate your plants slowly to avoid sunburn.", "Leaves turning brown: Leaves turn brown for a variety of reasons, some of which are perfectly normal and not cause for concern. For example, old leaves in the process of being discarded by your plant often turn brown before they drop. Caladium, Cupid's bow, and Rieger begonias, among others, have a pronounced dormant period in which all the plant's leaves turn brown as the plant prepares to go to sleep. This is also normal, and new leaves will grow when the dormant period is over. But leaves of some plants turn brown because they are sensitive to chemicals or water quality, others to low humidity. These conditions are not normal and are correctible; Bird's nest and davallia ferns are just two examples of plants that are sensitive to chemicals. Do not spray such plants with insecticides, fungicides, or leaf polishes. Insecticidal soap is safe to use if you need to, but avoid all others; Many plants (peacock plant, spider plant, orchids, bromeliads) are sensitive to water quality and should be irrigated with filtered, rain-, or distilled water, rather than tap water; Raise the humidity for maidenhair fern or any plant that has begun to brown by misting it, setting the pot on a tray of water filled with pebbles, or putting a humidifier in the room.", "Leggy growth. All plants eventually shed their oldest leaves. As the plant grows taller and as the leaves near its base are shed, the stems or trunk of the plant is revealed. When your plant starts to look like a collection of sticks, each topped by a dust mop of foliage, it has become leggy. Keep in mind that for some plants this look is perfectly normal. Legginess can also occur when plants are grown in too much shade and become tall and spindly as they reach for light; Plants that have become leggy because they have dropped older leaves need a bit of corrective pruning. Prune them back by about a third to force side branches to grow out and make the plants bushier. Alternatively, pinch out the growing tips of the stems while the plants are still small to avoid legginess from the outset; Plants that are tall and spindly and have not dropped their older leaves are not getting enough light. Either move these plants to a higher light location or remove curtains that filter the light. As always, slowly and carefully acclimate your plants to higher light intensity to avoid sunburn.", "Loss of vigor: The flowers of spring bulbs and the smaller, more colorful calla lilies are smaller, and the plants less vigorous than they were in their first year; Make certain your plant has the proper light regime. Remember, light is food. Also, be sure to provide fertilizer regularly through the growing season and none at all during dormancy. You want the plant to store as much food and nutrients as possible in its underground rhizomes so that it has abundant resources to mobilize the next time it flowers. The more energy it has available from its stores the more vigorous it will be. When the plant is completely dormant put it in a cool place out of the hot sun. Cool temperatures help it conserve stored energy. Treat these plants right and they should reward you with ample flowers every year for years to come.", "Needle drop: Norfolk Island pine tends to drop needles on the floor. As with any plant, dropping the oldest leaves (or needles) is normal and to be expected. However, when Norfolk Island pine drops large quantities of its needles, it is experiencing some sort of environmental stress. Although it can grow new needles, it cannot replace ones that have been lost. Norfolk Island pine needs cool temperatures, high humidity, and moderate water to do its best. If the temperature goes too high, the humidity too low, or the plant gets too dry it becomes stressed and starts dropping needles. Avoid putting this plant near sources of hot air like furnace registers, space heaters, or fireplaces.  Check the plant portrait for specific requirements", "Plant collapse: All plants wilt, of course, but plant collapse is very dramatic. Nerve plant, in particular, needs ample water, high humidity, and filtered light to stay healthy. It is notorious for having hissy fits and fainting if its potting medium gets too dry, the humidity gets too low, or the light too bright. The plant wilts very quickly if it runs out of water. It will rehydrate if watered, but if it's been too dry too long (more than a couple of hours) it won't recover. Just make sure it also has good drainage because soggy soil can be lethal.", "Plant sprawl: Certain plants tend to lean dramatically to one side as they grow larger because their stems don't have the strength to hold them upright. This tendency to lean is exaggerated if the light source always comes from one side, forcing the plant to lean into the light. Pinching off the growing tips of the stems while these plants are young forces them to become bushier and therefore stronger and able to stand straighter. Tying the plant to a bamboo pole or stake also helps it keep its shape. Give the plant a quarter turn every week to keep it growing symmetrically and prevent it from leaning into the light.", "Post-repotting collapse: Up-potting and re-potting is a fairly traumatic experience for any plant. Even using the most careful technique, roots get broken or trimmed, stems and leaves are jostled and pruned, and water supply is interrupted. Most plants recover quickly, but tree ivy is notorious for collapsing completely after re-potting. Give all plants some TLC in a post-repotting recovery room, with a bit of shade and cooler temperatures to minimize water loss while they recover. Gently reintroduce them to their proper light and temperature regimes once they have perked up again.", "Premature dormancy: Many houseplants have a definite dormant period at some point in the year. Drought often acts as a trigger for a plant to enter dormancy. Thus, allowing your plant to go dry can cause it to go dormant sooner than it should. False shamrock is especially susceptible to this phenomenon. The leaves of plants other than cacti and succulents turn yellow, then brown, and then drop. In many cases the above-ground plant parts disappear completely. It is not dead, just sleeping, and will resume growth at the appropriate time. When cacti and succulents go dormant in winter they're far more subtle about it-they just stop growing; Maintain the proper moisture levels to keep a plant active and healthy until the right time for it to go dormant. Check the plant portraits for guidance on frequency and quantity of water for the plant in question.", "Salt burn: Leaves that turn brown around the edges, stunted plants, wilted plants, and roots that die at their tips are symptoms of salt burn. The salts show up as a white crust around the edge of the pot or on the surface of the potting medium, especially in dry weather. Any plant can suffer from salt burn due to accumulated fertilizer salts in the potting medium, or salts in the water supply. Common table salt, sodium chloride, is only one kind of salt. Other kinds of salt include mineral nutrients like potassium, phosphorus, and calcium from fertilizer; Do not use your tap water for your plants if you have hard water with a high mineral content or if you have a water softening system that uses table salt. Instead, use rainwater, bottled water, or distilled water. Whether you have hard water or not, the best practice is to flush fertilizer salts out of the pots once a month by pouring rain-water, bottled water, or distilled water onto the potting medium. Give it a thorough soaking. Then let the pot drain.", "Shrunken, Wrinkled Leaves: All succulents (e. g. , agave and aloe) and some orchids (e. g. , moth orchids) store water in their thick fleshy leaves. Leaves of these plants become shrunken and wrinkled when plants dry out too much. As soon as you notice this problem, mist and water the plant lightly, but do not soak it. The next day water it lightly again. Wait a couple of days and then water lightly a third time. Shortly thereafter the leaves should have fattened up nicely. Always avoid making the potting medium soggy because the roots of these kinds of plants do not tolerate much water and will quickly succumb to root rot fungus.", "Sunburn. Leaves develop large black and brown dead patches wherever they have been exposed to too much sunlight. Intense, direct, hot sunlight literally cooks the cells of the leaf and kills them. Your plant will grow healthy new leaves but the dead patches on the old leaves are permanent. Sunburn frequently occurs when a houseplant is moved outdoors for a summer vacation and is inadequately acclimated to its new environment. Solve this common problem by moving the plant to a shadier location. Filter and soften the light by installing sheer curtains or Venetian blinds. Acclimate your plant whenever you move it to a higher light situation.", "Whitish Spots on Leaves: These spots typically show up as lines or rings of pale tissue on the upper surface of the leaves of African violets, gloxinias, and other furry-leaved gesneriads. The spots develop when cold water is dripped onto the leaves. Use a watering can with a narrow spout so you can apply tepid water directly to the potting medium while keeping the leaves dry. You might also try setting the pot in a saucer full of water for 30 minutes. This is called watering from the bottom. Be careful if you try this because it is very easy to forget the plant and allow it to sit in water too long, which drastically increases the risk of root rot and gray mold.", "Wilting: Any plant that cannot move water up to its leaves will wilt. The leaves dangle and become flaccid. The growing tips of the stems droop and point to the ground. The whole plant suffers and, if the situation is not reversed, your plant will die. Wilting is a serious, life-threatening condition that results from four causes; The most frequent cause of wilting is that you forgot to water your plant. If you find to your horror that your plant has wilted because you forgot to water it, give it water immediately. Most plants will rehydrate quickly and suffer no consequences. If the potting medium is completely dry it may be reluctant to absorb water so immerse the entire pot in a bucket of water until it is completely saturated, then let it drain. Your plant should recover within a few hours. If it does not recover, it's dead. If your plant has wilted even though you've watered it regularly and the potting medium has ample moisture, suspect root rot, the second most frequent cause of wilting. Gently extract the plant from its pot without breaking stems or roots. Inspect the root system. If roots are mushy, and gray, black, or dark brown, then the root system has been invaded by a pathogenic fungus that has killed and eaten the roots; A third cause for wilting is that your plant is in a pot that is too small for it. If your plant has wilted, and you're certain you've watered it properly, and you've checked the root system and found it to be alive and healthy, your plant is most likely in too small a pot (rootbound). Plants that are rootbound have essentially filled their container with roots and there is not enough moisture-holding medium left in the pot. The roots run out of water shortly after watering and the plant wilts again. You need to do one of two things. Either up-pot your plant to a larger container with fresh potting medium, or re-pot your plant after trimming away excess roots; A less frequent but nevertheless important cause of wilting is hot moving air, as from a heat vent or space heater, sucking the water out of the leaves faster than the plant can handle. If your plant wilts and you know it has sufficient water, does not have root rot, and it is not rootbound, then check for sources of hot moving air. Usually a heat vent from a forced air furnace or an electric space heater will be the culprit. But any plant is likely to wilt when it sits in an open window, in full sun, on a hot afternoon, with the wind blowing.", "Yellowing Leaf Edges: Usually this is perfectly normal and is not actually a problem, though it can be worrisome to the grower. It occurs on the oldest leaves. As your plant grows and makes new leaves the oldest leaves begin to turn yellow, then brown, and then they die. This is a normal part of the aging process for any leaf. Just prune the dead leaves away.", "Yellowing Leaves: Yellowing occurs for many reasons. It's a bit like having a fever: it tells you something is wrong, but it doesn't tell you what. If yellowing leaves have tiny black dots or spots, then you have a fungal or bacterial infection. Have a look at Common Disease Problems on page 266. There may also be colonies of insect pests on the undersides of the leaves. Yellow leaves can also indicate nutritional deficiencies. Check the Introduction and plant portraits, and fertilize your plants in need; If dots, spots, or insects are absent, and you're certain the nutrient status is adequate, then yellow leaves are diagnostic for too much hot afternoon sun, need for acidic soil, or overwatering. Recheck plant portraits to verify that you are not overwatering any plant. Also make sure the drainage is good. Pay special attention to angel wing begonia, asparagus fern, and gardenia. Use an acid fertilizer for gardenias to acidify the potting medium. Keep asparagus fern out of hot, afternoon sun.", "Yellowing Patches on Leaves: Yellow blotches or patches in the middle of the leaf blade, in the absence of tiny brown or black spots or insect infestations, are due to nutritional deficiency. Besides the usual nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, your plant needs the secondary mineral nutrients of calcium, magnesium, and sulfur, and the micronutrient iron. Feed your plant with liquid organic kelp fertilizer to correct the nutritional deficiency. Spray a liquid preparation directly on the leaves. The leaves should turn green again within a couple of weeks; If the leaves do not turn green again after applying liquid kelp, and small brown spots appear in the yellow patches, you are dealing with leaf spot fungus infection; if no small brown spots develop in the yellow patches, you are dealing either with an insect infestation of some sort or with a virus infection.", "Every plant portrait lists the most common problems that occur for each plant. However, you may encounter less common problems as well. If something is not quite right with your plants and you've ruled out improper culture or disease, look at the photos and read the descriptions in this section to identify the culprit (and the symptoms it causes) and solve the problem, safely and organically. Some pests are quite common, while others are not. If you give your houseplants a summer vacation out doors, you may find that ants, earwigs, leafhoppers, slugs, snails, and thrips accompany the plants back inside; The first thing you should do if you have heavy insect infestations is to prune, pick, or break off any part of the plant that is badly affected. Then use other remedies as needed, remembering that even organic solutions can be toxic to people and pets. Take a moment to read and follow all product labels carefully. Clean tools and wash your hands thoroughly with hot soapy water before handling any healthy plants. Be sure to use soap, not detergent, because detergent can burn foliage.", "Ants: You are likely well aware of what an ant looks like, and they actually do little damage to your houseplant. But they can be unwelcome in the house; and some bite. Some species bring aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects to plants so that the ants can 'milk' them for their honeydew while the pests feed on your plant (honeydew is actually sweet, sticky insect excrement); sounds yucky, but it's actually kind of fascinating to watch. If ants infest your plants, put the pots on pebbles in a tray of water, because ants cannot swim. Alternatively, use sticky bands (which work like old-fashioned fly-paper) or spray with insecticidal soap.", "Aphids: These tiny, green, woolly-gray, black, or brown, soft-bodied, pear-shaped insects cluster on the undersides of leaves. Look for two tubes on their rear ends to be sure you've spotted aphids. They're hard to see, but if you look closely or with a hand lens, you'll see the tubes. Other symptoms you might see: the tips of stems or branches curl, cup, or deform; or you find a sticky, clear, varnish-like residue on leaves or stems. These pests are very common. Wash aphids off the plant using plain water, soapy water, or rubbing alcohol. Alternatively, spray with insecticidal soap or horticultural oil.", "Earwigs: These small brown and black pests have two pincers on their rear ends. They hide during the day and come out at night to eat holes in tender, young leaves. They are uncommon on houseplants but may have hitched a ride into your home on a plant you had outdoors for the summer. You can pick these pests off by hand, but the simplest earwig trap is a moist, rolled-up newspaper. Roll it fairly loosely and secure it with a rubber band. Moisten it slightly and lay it on the potting media in the evening. The earwigs hide in there overnight. Retrieve the paper in the morning, close up the ends, and roll the paper tightly so that earwigs cannot escape. Seal it, along with its hidden earwigs, in a plastic bag and put that in the garbage. Alternatively, spray with spinosad.", "Leafhoppers. Another uncommon pest on houseplants, leafhoppers are fast fliers and may disappear before you get a good look. The first sign you'll see are tiny white specks stippling the leaves. Leaf edges might turn yellow, and then brown. If you do get a glimpse of the bug, it is wedge-shaped, greenish blue or brownish gray, and up to 0. 5 inch long. These insects may enter your home if you've put a plant outside for awhile. They transmit serious bacterial and viral diseases to plants. Solve this pest problem by spraying with insecticidal soap, neem oil, or horticultural oil.", "Mealybugs: These pests are very common on houseplants. Your first hint is fluffy grayish white lumps suddenly appearing on the undersides of leaves and where leaves attach to stems. These insects cannot fly. They coat the surface of leaves and stems with clear, sticky, varnish-like honeydew. A gray-black coating (sooty mold) that easily rubs off may grow on the honeydew. Wash mealybugs off the plant using plain water, soapy water, or rubbing alcohol. Alternatively, spray with insecticidal soap or horticultural oil.", "Scale insects:Small, gray-white, reddish brown, yellow, or black lumps stick to the surfaces of leaves, or to stems. You can easily remove them with your thumbnail. Like mealybugs and aphids, these buggers coat the upper surfaces of leaves with clear, sticky, varnish-like honeydew. Sooty mold-a gray-black coating that easily rubs off-forms on the honeydew. Scale is very common on houseplants. Pick pests off by hand, or spray with insecticidal soap or horticultural oil.", "Slugs and snails. You'll rarely see these two mollusk pests inside, but they do hitchhike on summer vacationing houseplants. Since both of these critters hide during the day, the first hint you may have is large irregular holes in the leaves. If you spot slime trails, then you know slugs or snails are the culprits. Pick them off by hand, or trap them by creating hiding places, like a small overturned pot, so that the critters seek refuge at night beneath them. Then you can easily find and destroy the slugs or snails, or move them back outside where they belong.  Alternatively, sprinkle iron phosphate on top of the potting medium", "Spider mites: Although a very common pest on houseplants, you'll probably never see a spider mite (unless you have bionic eyes). You will see that leaves are stippled with tiny pale dots that sometimes turn the whole leaf bronze-colored. Fine webbing, like spider silk, covers leaves and stems over time. Badly infested leaves turn yellow or red and drop off the plant. Wash mites off the plant using plain water, soapy water, or rubbing alcohol. Alternatively, spray with insecticidal soap or horticultural oil.", "Thrips: You will probably have problems with thrips only if you've given your plants a trip to the patio. Thrips are very tiny yellowy orange insects, and you'll likely never see them. They congregate on flower petals and leaves. The symptoms you might see include silvery leaves, slivery streaks on leaves, or damaged leaves that roll up and drop off. Wash thrips off the plant using plain water, soapy water, or rubbing alcohol. Alternatively, spray with insecticidal soap or spinosad.", "Whiteflies: You see small, bright white insects fly away when you disturb your plant. Large colonies on the undersides of leaves deposit patches of white residue. These insects, which are very common on houseplants, coat the upper surfaces of leaves with clear, sticky, varnish-like honeydew. Sooty mold-a gray-black coating that easily rubs off-forms on the honeydew. Wash these pests off the plant using plain water, soapy water, or rubbing alcohol. Alternatively, spray with insecticidal soap or horticultural oil.", "Commercial fertilizer packages often describe their contents as 'plant food'. This is a misnomer. Fertilizer contains mineral nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium that plants require for growth, but any plant's actual food, what they actually eat, is the sugar they make from sunlight and carbon dioxide. When you breathe on your plants you are truly feeding them. They absorb the carbon dioxide from your breath, combine it with solar energy through photosynthesis, and manufacture sugar from it. When they metabolize the sugar it provides them with the fuel they need to grow new leaves, roots, stems, and flowers; Plants need more than just sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water; they also require 12 essential mineral nutrients. In nature, plants obtain these nutrients from animal droppings, dead animals, and dead plant material. Houseplants have to obtain them from their more limited environment: if the organic potting medium you use has organic fertilizer and compost incorporated into it, your plant will get the nutrients it needs. The overwhelming majority of houseplants are not fussy about nutrients, but if the potting medium contains no fertilizer then you may need to add organic fertilizer. You may also need to add fertilizer later, after the plant has grown. Look to its portrait to determine a plant's fertilizer needs.", "All fertilizers have three numbers on the front of the package (e. g. , 6-12-4 or 10-10-10), which stand for the percentages of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), in that order. These three essential nutrients are called primary or macronutrients because plants need them in relatively large quantities compared to the other nine; Nitrogen (the first number) is vital for vegetative growth. A plant has to have nitrogen in order to grow new leaves, roots, stems, and so forth. High nitrogen promotes the lush growth of green leaves, so that any houseplant grown primarily for its attractive foliage, as opposed to flowers, needs a high-nitrogen fertilizer. Phosphorus (the middle number) is necessary for flowering and strong roots. Plants need phosphorus in order to initiate, develop, and maintain their flowers. This is why the percent of phosphorus is high in fertilizers designed for flowering bulbs. Any flowering houseplant grown primarily for its beautiful flowers, as opposed to its foliage, needs a fertilizer with a relatively high phosphorus component. Potassium (the last number) promotes strong stems and provides stress protection for plants. Your plant is better able to withstand extremes (too much or too little) of essential environmental variables such as light, temperature, and water if it's getting adequate potassium; The secondary essential mineral nutrients are calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. They are not needed in quantities as large as the macro-nutrients, but they are still essential for healthy plants. Six micronutrients, needed in minute quantities, are boron, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc; Plants require all 12 of the mineral nutri ents just named in order to stay healthy. In addition to the 12, they also need the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen they obtain from carbon dioxide and water in order to manufacture sugar. A good, high-quality, organic potting soil that contains organic fertilizer should supply all 12 of the essential mineral nutrients that your houseplant needs.", "Here is the list of nutrient usage: 1. Nitrogen, for Vegetative growth, protein synthesis for new tissue. 2. Phosphorus, for Flower and fruit production. 3. Potassium, for Strong stems and stress protection. 4. Calcium, essential for numerous metabolic and physiological processes. 5. Magnesium, essential for growth and is a component of chlorophyll. 6. Sulfur, vital for plant growth, especially roots and seed production. 7. Boron, necessary component of cell walls and membrane function. 8. Copper, necessary for photosynthesis and plant growth. 9. Iron, necessary for photosynthesis. 10. Manganese, important for carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism. 11. Molybdenum, important for nitrogen metabolism. 12. Zinc, important for growth hormones and enzyme systems.", "Water moves through a plant's body through a process called transpiration. The roots absorb water from the soil, then move it upward through the stem and out into the leaves. Water, as a vapor, moves out of the leaf into the air through special pores called stomates. Losing water through its leaves is a vital and necessary process for your plant. Just as your heart beats to pump blood to every cell in your body, so transpiration bathes every cell in a plant's body in nutrients carried by water; If humidity is high a plant loses water more slowly from its leaves. If humidity is low a plant loses water rapidly from its leaves. Two other factors influence this process. First is the availability of water. If your potting medium is adequately moist then the plant is able to mine the soil with its roots for the water it needs. Conversely, if water is not available because you forgot to water and the medium is dry, then your plant can get into trouble quickly. The second factor is ambient air temperature. As the air temperature goes up humidity goes down; as the temperature goes down humidity goes up. Placing your plant too close to a hot air register or other heat source will suck the water right out of the leaves very quickly; Depending on your climate, dry or humid, you may need to mist your indoor plants about once a week, as we did when we lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In the Pacific Northwest, where we live now, many of our plants do not need misting, even in the dry summer months.", "Plants eat light! They harvest solar energy and convert it to chemical energy. They turn sun light into sugar and they 'burn' the sugar in order to grow, flower, and thrive. In the com plete absence of light all plants die sooner or later. The amount of time they can live with out light depends on how much sugar, starch, or complex carbohydrates they have manufactured and stored in their tissues. If they cannot manu facture food they have to metabolize stored food until the stores run out. Without light, plants starve to death; All houseplants originally came to us from native habitats where they had evolved and adapted to local environmental conditions for millions of years. Houseplants whose native habitat is the shady floor of a rainforest, for example, thrive under low light conditions. But keep in mind that even in shady natural habi tats, plants are not really in permanent shade. They still receive a significant amount of ambi ent light from the sky (aka skylight: blue light that radiates from the sky). Conversely, plants whose native habitat is the brilliant sun of a des ert require the maximum amount of light your home can provide; The intensity and duration of light, and a plant's distance from the light source are the most important environmental parameters to consider as you prepare for success with any houseplant. Houses designed for humans are dark compared to houses built for plants-such as a greenhouse filled with bright light. When we bring a companion plant into our homes we need to be very cognizant of the intensity of light that particular plant needs and how long it needs it. In the plant portraits section of this book each plant's light requirement, whether high, medium, or low, is listed; As you place your plants in the right light, bear in mind that they need to be acclimated to their new home. Acclimatize a recently acquired plant to full sun slowly over a period of a cou ple of weeks. Give it two hours a day for four days, then four hours a day for four days, then six hours for four days, and so forth. By the time your plant tolerates eight hours a day of full intense sun it will be acclimated well enough to tolerate full sun all day without burning.", "Light attributes in your home. The first thing you'll need to do is figure out which window faces which direction. In the morning, when you're having your coffee, which window gives you the best view of the sunrise? That window faces east. As you face that east window, know that south is on your right and north is on your left. West is behind you; The second thing you'll need to figure out is how far away from the window your plant is going to live. If the leaves of your plant are 2 feet away from the window then your plant is only getting one-fourth of the light it would receive if it were right next to the window. This phe nomenon is called the inverse square law, and you can use this simple mathematical formula to help your plants get the light they need. Who knew there'd be math when all you want to do is grow a plant? But really, it's simple. All you need is a tape measure and a calculator (or a piece of paper and pencil if you're old school); According to this law, the intensity of light decreases as the square of the distance from the source of the light. So, if the plant is 2 feet away, then 2 squared (2 × 2) = 4, and your plant is only getting one-fourth of the light available. Four feet away = one-sixteenth the light (4 × 4 = 16), and so forth. As you can see, the further your plant is from a light source, the less energy it receives. The same rule applies to artificial light, by the way.", "High light. Full sun all day, south-facing window. The brilliant, intense sunlight of a cloudless summer day at noon as it pours through a south window is the brightest possible light for a houseplant. Imagine a houseplant sitting in its pot on the sill of a south window. The plant has received direct sunlight all morning and will receive it all afternoon as well. The intensity and duration of light is at its maximum. The number of hours of light in a south window changes from summer, when the days are long, to win ter, when the days are short, but it is always intense, direct, full sunlight. A barrel cactus or agave thrives under these conditions, while an African violet would die. In fact, the majority of good houseplants will not do well in the intense unfiltered light of a south window but those that require high light will do very well indeed.", "High light. Bright indirect light, south-facing window. Imagine drawing a sheer, lacy, or gauzy white curtain over a south window. The curtain hangs between the plant and the window; your plant is now receiving very bright, but filtered light. Though the plant is no longer exposed to direct sun, it's still in a high light situation. You can further modify the light intensity by your choice of curtains. The more 'see through' the curtain the brighter the light, and the heavier the curtain the less light.", "Medium light. Full sun half a day, east- and west-facing windows. In contrast to the light of a south window, it is impossible for an east or west window to receive a full day of sunshine. They receive only a half-day of intense, direct sunshine; the rest of the day they receive only skylight. East or west windows give plants a medium light regime; An east window will be high light intensity in the morning when the sun is rising and the air is cool. East windows will be low light intensity all afternoon. Most houseplants will perform quite well in an east window with cool morning light; A west window will be high light intensity all afternoon when the sun is setting and the air temperature is hot. West windows will be low light intensity all morning long. Heat lovers like many cacti and succulents will actually do fine in a west window because they prefer those hot afternoons.", "Medium light. Dappled light. Venetian blinds on a south, east, or west window that gets full, direct, intense sunlight simulate the kind of dappled light a plant receives from an overhanging tree. A plant on the sill of a window with Venetian blinds receives alternating bands of intense hot sun and cool shade that move across the leaves as the sun moves across the sky. You control how much light the plant gets by opening or closing the blinds to make the bars of light and shade narrow or wide. Thus, the plant gets half direct, intense sun and half cooling shade, both of which move across the plant's surface.", "Medium light. Filtered light. Drawing a sheer or gauzy curtain over a south-, east-, or west facing window creates filtered light", "Low light. Shade all day, north-facing windows. Windows that face north never receive any direct sunshine. The only light they receive is the ambient blue light that radiates from the sky. North windows are a low light regime, especially in winter when the sun is low in the sky and the days are short. The majority of houseplants will not do well in a north window; cast-iron plant and a few others do okay in a north window. If a north window is all you have to work with, you might consider growing houseplants in artificial light rather than natural daylight.", "Low light. Ambient light all day from sky lights in the ceiling. Many homes have skylights in the ceilings of various rooms in the house. They bring the ambient blue light of the sky into your home all day long. Plants that prefer low light levels will do especially well in the light provided by these skylights. However, sky lights also allow a patch of direct, intense sunshine to move across your room from morning to night. If your plant is in a location that will be spotlighted by a patch of brilliant, intense sunlight, you might need to move it out of that patch for a couple hours each day. The path that patch of sunshine takes across your room changes with the seasons. Observe the patch's path so that your plant does not get sunburn.", "With artificial light you can forget about your windows and skylights and grow houseplants anywhere. Well, almost anywhere, and not all houseplants; A very large array of light fixtures suitable for houseplants is available today. They range from simple desk lamps with containers for houseplants at the base to complex systems of multi-stacked shelves with lighting above each shelf. With these light systems in place, any dark corner can be brightened up with houseplants; No matter what system you use, choose a light source that gives off the proper wave lengths of light for your plant. Different kinds of bulbs emit different wavelengths of light, and plants use different wavelengths of light for dif ferent purposes. You need blue and red light if all you want is good foliage growth, but you need red and far red light if you want your plant to make flowers. Look at the packaging the bulb comes in to determine its light quality; Standard cool-white daylight fluorescent tubes emit light in the blue and red range and are very suitable for vegetative growth. They do a very good job for foliage plants. The spe cial fluorescent bulbs designed to promote plant growth and flowering, called grow lights, are expensive but are designed to emit the right quality of light (blue, red, and far red). They also avoid the heat load generated by incandescent, high-intensity discharge lamps, high pressure sodium, and metal halide lights. LED lights are a low-heat artificial light source, as well as being energy efficient; A final consideration is the size of the plant you want to grow. Tall plants, like palms, other trees, and large shrubs, are very difficult (often impossible) to get close enough to your light source for the light to do much good due to the inverse square law discussed earlier; Your best option for growing houseplants under artificial lights in your home is to concentrate on low-growing plants that can be positioned close to the bulbs. African violets, lady's slippers, and moth orchids are some of the very best choices for this purpose.", "Most people want to replace their houseplant's original pot with something more attractive. After all, your companion plant should fit into your decor in a container that complements your home and those cheap, thin-walled plastic pots that come from the nursery don't quite reach the mark.", "When you first get your plant, examine it to see if it would profit from being moved into a larger container (up-potting). Check by pulling the plant out of its pot and looking at the root ball. This will not harm the plant if you treat it gently; If there are only a few roots visible on the sides of the root ball and the potting medium starts to fall apart when you poke it with your finger just push the plant back into its container and wait a year or so before up-potting. If you pull your plant out of its cheap plastic container and the root ball is covered by a healthy network of white roots strongly holding together the mass of potting medium in a compact ball, then you can go ahead and up-pot your plant into a larger container; Another factor to consider is the rate at which plants grow. Some houseplants grow slowly by nature and some grow fast, but both will eventually need to be up-potted. When you're certain your plant is ready for a new, larger pot, use a tape measure to determine the diameter of the old original pot. It's important to know the size of the container whenever it comes time to move your plant up to a larger pot; The new pot should be no more than 2 to 4 inches larger than the current pot. Why? Because a small plant with a small root system is physically incapable of mining a large volume of soil for moisture with the result that the potting medium stays too wet too long and the roots rot. You have to move a plant up in increments until you get your plant into the size of pot you want it to live in for a very long time; For a slow-growing plant the new pot should be 2 inches larger in diameter. For a fast-growing plant the new pot should be 4 inches larger. In other words, when you up-pot a slow-growing plant in a 4-inch pot, move it into a 6-inch pot. This will give you 1 inch of fresh potting medium packed around all sides of the root ball. When you up-pot a fast-growing plant in a 4-inch pot, put it into an 8-inch pot. This will give you 2 inches of fresh potting medium packed around all sides of the root ball. A really vigorous plant growing rapidly will quickly fill 2 inches of fresh potting medium with healthy roots, but a slow-growing plant cannot do so; Keep in mind that some houseplants are destined to always be small, even when fully mature. An African violet comes to mind as a kind of plant that can never become large, like a tree. It will always be small even when fully mature and can live quite happily in a 4-inch pot. A rubber tree in a 4-inch pot, by contrast, will quickly outgrow the pot and need to be up-potted to a bigger container. Since the rubber tree is a forest giant in the wild, it can easily reach the ceiling in your home if you give it a large enough pot.", "If your houseplant has reached the perfect size for your space (i. e. , you do not want it to get much larger than it is), you don't want to move it into a larger pot. To restrict (or maintain) a plant's size you re-pot it and put it back into the same container, or a same-size container; Pull the plant out of its container and examine the roots. You'll probably see a tangled mass of solid roots and you won't be able to see any potting medium. Using a clean, sterile, sharp knife, slice off 1 inch of the root ball on all sides and across the bottom. Pack the bottom of the pot with 1 inch of fresh potting medium and put your plant back in its pot, then pack the sides of the pot with 1 inch of fresh potting medium. In two to three years your plant will once again need to be re-potted and you'll just repeat this process.", "Division, cuttings, and layering are tried and true methods of asexual propagation that make exact copies of your parent plant. Each plant portrait in this book tells you which propagation technique(s) can be used for that particular plant. You should be aware, however, that many cultivars are protected by plant patents. You may legally propagate as many patented plants as you desire, but for your own use only. It is illegal for you to sell them. Only the patent holder or licensee has the right to sell these plants.", "Propagation techniques involve cutting or wounding your plant with a knife or pruners. Whatever tool you use, be sure it is clean, sharp, and above all sterile before you start cutting your plant. The reason you have to sterilize your tools is because a large number of virus diseases and bacterial diseases infect plants, and the viruses and bacteria that cause them are routinely spread from plant to plant by pruners and knives. If you use a pruner on a plant that is infected with a virus, and then use the same pruner on a healthy plant without sterilizing it between plants, you'll probably infect your healthy plant; Orchid collections worldwide are infected with cymbidium mosaic virus and ringspot virus, for example. Orchid fanciers routinely sterilize their pruners with a blow torch to kill any virus particles clinging to the blades. African violet fanciers sterilize their tools by soaking them in rubbing alcohol. Another technique is to soak your tools in a 10% bleach solution (1 part household bleach to 9 parts water). Bleach corrodes your tools badly but is very effective at killing pathogens. Still another technique is to use single-edge razor blades that can be discarded after use, or wrapped in aluminum foil and boiled in water for 20 minutes for re-use.", "Simple division is the easiest of all methods for making identical copies of your houseplants. You simply cut your plant into two or more pieces. That said, whenever you cut pieces off your plant you must reduce water loss or your divisions will desiccate and die. You accomplish this by removing one-third to one-half of the leaves from each division. Either cut off the leaves at the bottom of the stems, or cut leaves in half; There are five types of divisions: rhizomes, tubers, stolons, pups, and keikis. For all divisions pot them in the same potting medium you used for the original plant. Keep humidity high and reduce water loss by putting a glass jar or plastic bag over each division until it is once again in active growth. Open up or remove this cover for an hour or so every day to let in air. Keep the divisions in a warm location in low light. Water cautiously till they're well rooted in their new location and actively making new leaves. When they are fully established, remove the cover and acclimatize them to their permanent location in the proper light and temperature conditions for that particular plant.", "RHIZOMES. Some houseplants (many orchids, ferns, snake plant, cast-iron plant) have a rhizome, a specialized horizontal underground stem that sends up new shoots at regular intervals. Using a clean, sterilized, sharp knife or pruners you can cut this rhizome into two or more pieces, making sure each piece has its own roots, stems, and leaves. Gently pull the parent plant apart to disentangle the roots as you go.", "TUBERS. Calla lily, caladium, and gloxinia have underground tubers. Use a clean, sterilized, sharp knife to cut the tuber into two or more pieces during the plant's dormant period.", "A few plants, such as spider plant and creeping saxifrage, have specialized above-ground stems called runners or stolons that make plantlets (just like a strawberry plant). Using a clean, sterilized, sharp knife or pruners you can cut this runner into two or more pieces, making sure each piece has its own roots, stems, and leaves.", "PUPS. Other houseplants (all bromeliads, many succulents, some cacti, a few palms) produce new shoots, or pups, around the base of the old mother plant. When these pups have enough roots they can be removed from their mother plant and planted in their own pots. Separate a pup from the parent plant with a clean, sterilized, sharp knife or pruners. Make sure to include a decent amount of roots.", "KEIKIS. Moth orchids often produce a keiki (Hawaiian for 'child') on their old flowering stems. These little plants develop leaves and roots while still attached to the old inflorescence. When they look large enough to survive on their own you can separate them from the mother plant with a clean, sterilized, sharp knife or pruners.  Make sure to get all the roots.", "Cuttings, Another easy method for propagation of houseplants is from cut pieces of stems or leaves. Most houseplants have stems that will sprout roots under the right conditions, however, palms are a notable exception and will be killed if you cut their tops off. Only a few plants are able to regenerate new plants from their leaves. Again, each plant portrait will tell you which propagation technique(s) can be used for that particular plant; There are three types of cuttings: stem tip cuttings, stem cuttings, and leaf cuttings. For all cuttings pot them in the same potting medium you used for the original plant. Keep humidity high and reduce water loss by putting a glass jar or plastic bag over each cutting until it is once again in active growth. Open up or remove this cover for an hour or so every day to let in air. Keep the cuttings in a warm location in low light; Water cautiously till they're well rooted in their new location and actively making new leaves.", "Stem tip cuttings. Make a basic stem tip cutting by removing the top 6 to 8 inches from the tips of the stems. Always make your cut just below a node (the place where a leaf is, or was, attached to the stem) because the new root system will grow out of that node. Always use a clean, sterilized, sharp knife or pruners. Trim off all but the top two leaves of these cuttings and cut the remaining leaves in half in order to reduce water loss and prevent your cutting from suffering desiccation and death. Dip the bottom end of the cuttings in rooting hormones and plant them in moist sand. Alternatively, put cuttings in a jar of water. Many stems, but not all, will grow roots. Through the glass you can watch the roots develop. For both methods, when the leaves begin active growth again, pot them up.", "Stem cuttings. Some plants will grow new roots and shoots from short, leafless pieces of stem. If one of these plants has gotten too tall, cut off the leafy top and treat it like a stem tip cutting. You'll be left with a bare stick or cane growing out of your pot. The bare cane will grow a new leafy top, but, if you'd like your plant to be even shorter, you can cut 6- to 8-inch-long sections from that cane and root them using the following directions. The stump you leave behind will grow a new top. Again, do not try this with a palm; you'll kill it; Use a clean, sterilized, sharp knife or prun ers to cut the topless cane off at the new height you want your original plant to become. Use a marker to mark the bottom of the cane you just lopped off (the opposite end from the leaves) so you can tell which is the bottom (toward the ground) and which is the top (toward the leaves). If your section of stem is long enough, cut it into 6- to 8-inch-long pieces, again marking the bottom end of each piece. The plant knows up from down. Roots will grow only from the bottom end and shoots will grow only from the top end, so be sure to plant it top end up and bottom end down. Let the pieces air dry for three days or so. Plant them in moist sand and the stems will grow new roots and shoots. When they are well rooted, pot them up in the same potting medium as the original plant; An alternative technique specifically for ti is to cut the stem into 2-inch-long pieces and plant the pieces on their sides in moist sand or in a 50/50 mix of perlite and vermiculite. Each piece will grow into a new plant. In the meantime, the stump of your original plant will have sprouted new shoots and be rejuvenated.", "A few plants are easily propagated by rooting their leaves. You can put several leaf cuttings in one pot or container filled with moist sand or a 50/50 mix of perlite and vermiculite. Keep humidity high and reduce water loss by putting a glass jar or plastic bag over each pot. Open up or remove this cover for an hour or so every day to let in air. Keep the leaf cuttings in a warm location in low light. It will take several weeks for roots to form. A gentle tug on a leaf cutting will reveal whether it has rooted or not. In a couple of months they will have made new little plantlets. At this point you can pot them up in individual pots using the same potting medium you used for the original plant. Four types of plants propagate especially well from leaf cuttings.", "Layering is a technique that causes a stem to make roots while the stem is still attached to the mother plant. There are two ways to layer plants.  Simple layering is quick and easy, air layering is time-consuming, tricky, and difficult", "Simple layering. Plants with long, flexible stems (like pothos and arrowhead plant) are particularly easy to propagate using simple layering. Plants with flexible specialized stems called stolons (like spider plant and creeping saxifrage) are also easily handled with this technique. All you need to do is select a container for your newly propagated plant to grow in and fill it with the potting medium appropriate for the plant in question. Moisten the potting medium with water, let it drain, and set the container close enough to your mother plant to allow you to pick up a healthy stem or stolon and lay it on the surface of the container; STOLONS. If you're working with a stolon, there will be little plantlets at its nodes. Adjust the position of your pot and stolon to place one of these little plantlets in the center of your container. Use a U-shaped staple or piece of wire to pin the stolon to the potting medium with the little roots pushed down into the soil. The roots will be stimulated by the moist potting medium and will begin to grow. In a few weeks, when the little plant is well rooted and actively growing new leaves, you can cut the stolon and sever the connection between the little plant and the mother plant; VINES. To propagate a vine, such as pothos, adjust the position of your pot to place the fourth leaf from the tip of the stem in the center of your container. The place where the leaf attaches to the stem is a node. There will usually be one or two fat little roots sticking out of the node on the side of the stem opposite the leaf. Push these little roots down into the soil. Use a U-shaped staple or piece of wire to pin the stem to the potting medium with the leaf pointing up. Cut the leaf off with a clean, sterilized, sharp knife or pruners and discard it; You now have a length of stem with three leaves on it on the side of the node away from the mother plant. The stem is still connected to the mother plant. The roots at the node pinned to the potting medium will be stimulated by the moist medium and will begin to grow; In a few weeks, the dormant bud at the node where the leaf you removed was attached to the stem will have grown out into a new stem and will be well rooted. At this point you cut the stem between the little plantlet and the mother plant to sever the tie between them. Now you have a new little plant with two growing stems, the original three-leaf stem tip plus the new stem that sprouted from the node.", "Air layering. This is the most time-consuming and trickiest method of propagation for houseplants but is, nevertheless, a valuable tool for plants such as rubber tree and fiddle-leaf fig that are difficult or impossible to root using easier methods. As in simple layering, what you're attempting to do is to make a stem grow roots while it's still attached to the mother plant. But, unlike vines or stolons, these plants have rigid, non-flexible stems so it's very difficult to bend such a stem down to attach it to a container of potting medium without breaking it. The solution is to bring the potting medium up to the plant. Here are the 12 steps to successfully propagate plants by air layering: 1. Select a point 8 to 12 inches down from the tip of a healthy young stem and, using a clean, sterilized, sharp knife cut one-third of the way into the stem at an upward angle just below a node (the place where a leaf was attached to the stem). Do not cut more than one-third of the way through the stem, and support the stem above the wound so that it doesn't break off. 2. Remove a leaf or two if they are in your way. 3. When you wound them, rubber tree or fiddle-leaf fig will bleed milky white sap that dries to rubber. Wipe away the sap with a damp cloth. 4. Prop the wound open by inserting a toothpick sideways into the cut. 5. Put rooting hormones in the wound and wrap the wound with a couple handfuls of moistened, stringy, sphagnum moss. 6. While holding the moss in place, wrap the ball of moss in a cylinder of two layers of plastic. 7. Tape the top and bottom shut with electrical tape but leave the top of the package loose enough to add water to the inside. 8. Pour enough water inside every few days to keep the sphagnum moss moist. 9. In a month or two you'll see new roots forming inside the plastic, but sometimes it can take six to eight months for roots to form, so be patient. 10. When the new roots are about 2 inches long, remove the plastic wrapping, cut the stem off the parent plant just below the new little root ball. Do not remove the sphagnum moss from the root ball. 11. Pot up your new plant. 12. Keep it in a warm, shady location until it's adjusted to its new life independent from the original plant.", "Seed. Some houseplants are easy to propagate from seed. This method takes a long time (years) to grow a decent-sized woody plant like a citrus tree, but it is much faster for herbaceous perennials like geraniums. Also, because seeds are the result of sexual reproduction, each seedling, like your own child, is a unique individual and different from its mother plant. If you want to make an identical copy of your plants then you need to propagate them asexually by division, cuttings, or layering; Specialty seed companies offer seeds of many houseplants with clear instructions printed on the package or in their catalogs regarding the appropriate sowing medium, sowing depth, soil temperature, watering, and the light regime each kind of seed needs in order to germinate successfully.", "Success with a particular houseplant depends on knowing the daily temperature regime (daytime high and nighttime low) that plant needs to flourish under your care. Fortunately, plants are fairly forgiving and will adjust to day or night temperatures within a range of about ten degrees Fahrenhreit. The plant portrait of each houseplant specifies the appropriate temperature range, daytime and nighttime, for best suc cess with that plant; Night temperatures are critical for houseplants because plants cannot manufacture food (sugar) through photosynthesis when the sun is not shining. In order to maintain metabolism and growth at night the plant has to burn some of the food it made during the day. For plants, metabolizing food is called respiration. Respiration is the exact opposite process from photosynthesis and it is critically linked to tem perature. As the temperature goes up metabolism goes up. As the nighttime temperature goes higher a plant will reach a point where it has burned up all the food it made during the day. At even higher temperatures it will burn up all its reserve food supply. Pretty soon the plant will be dead. This is why those irresistibly cute little miniature roses in 4-inch pots die within a couple weeks when you bring them home from the store. The warm nighttime temperature of our homes kills them. They are not only happy but exquisite if you plant them outdoors in the garden where nights are cold. They, like almost all temperate zone plants, are not houseplants.", "Plants that grow best in really warm temperatures generally do well with a daytime range of 75 to 85°F and a nighttime range of 65 to 75°F.", "Plants that prefer moderate temperatures perform well with a daytime range of 70 to 80°F and a nighttime range of 60 to 70°F.", "Plants that need low tem peratures tolerate a daytime range of 65 to 75°F and a nighttime range of 55 to 65°F.", "The goal of any watering practice or system is to keep the soil moist-neither soggy nor dry. Root rot as a result of overwatering is the number one killer of all plants in containers whether indoors or out. This fact, more than any other, tells us that appropriate watering is not as easy as it seems, and most people are too generous; Not all plants are created equal with respect to their water needs. Some plants, bananas for example, really need a lot of water. Other plants, such as many cacti, would die swiftly if they were watered as much as a banana plant; Never water your houseplants with cold water straight from the cold water faucet. Cold water is shocking to these tropical beauties. Always use cool, tepid (not cold, not hot) water. One technique is to fill a pitcher or jug with water and let it sit overnight to warm up to room temperature. Another is to turn on the hot water just enough to warm the cold water slightly and take the chill of.", "How to tell when to water. Determine when you need to water your plants with a simple finger test. The dry potting medium at the surface of the pot will be at room temperature. Stick your finger down into the potting medium, and you will eventually feel cool, moist soil with the tip of your finger. Use your finger to measure how thick the dry medium is at the surface of the pot; If you don't trust your finger, or you just don't like to get it dirty, there are a number of devices available to determine when a plant needs to be watered. Some are battery-operated probes that you insert into the potting medium. These have an indicator needle on a gauge or a digi tal readout, either of which will help you deter mine the thickness of the dry potting medium. Other kinds of devices are little porous clay objects (some are shaped like little earthworms) that you insert into the potting medium. These turn dark when they are wet and light when they are dry; The plant portraits will give you specific guidelines on water needs for each plant.", "Ample water. Plants that prefer ample water need to be watered when the top of the potting medium is dry to a depth of 0. 5 inch.", "Moderate water. Plants that prefer moderate water need to be watered when the top of the potting medium is dry to a depth of 1 inch.", "Low water. Plants that prefer low water need to be watered when the top of the potting medium is dry to a depth of 2 inches.", "How frequently you need to water depends on plant requirements, on how porous your pots are, and other factors. Unglazed clay (terracotta) pots are porous. Water evaporates through the walls of these pots very well so they dry out pretty quickly. In garden jargon these pots are said to breathe. Plastic pots, or glazed ceramic, glass, or metal pots do not breathe. Their walls are impervious to water so the potting medium stays moist much longer than in unglazed clay pots; Ambient air temperature, humidity, and daylength also play a role with regard to frequency of watering. A houseplant's need for water goes up when the temperature goes up, or when it bursts into active growth, or begins to flower. On hot, dry summer days you need to water houseplants more frequently than on cool, moist winter days-even though the plants are inside the house and protected from temperature extremes; Another factor to consider with regard to watering your houseplants is the potting medium itself. A general-purpose potting medium is designed to absorb and retain sufficient moisture, to allow free water to drain away adequately, and also to provide ample air for good root growth. Some potting media, African violet mixes for example, are designed to retain a little more moisture than a general-purpose potting medium. Other potting media, such as a cactus mix or orchid bark, are designed not to retain much water; they are said to drain well.", "As a general rule, never let a houseplant sit with the bottom of its pot in a puddle of water in its saucer for more than an hour or so. If the potting medium is moist (not soaking wet, not bone dry) then you're doing a good job. Water your plants until you see water begin to come out the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot, then stop watering. If the pot is propped up on pot feet or pebbles so that the bottom of the pot does not sit in a pool of water, you can let the water stand in the saucer. This standing water will help increase humidity. If your pot is not propped up on pot feet or pebbles, check back within 30 minutes to an hour. If there is any water left in the saucer, remove the saucer and discard the water. Put your plant back in the saucer and you're good to go until the next time you need to water.", "A good watering can for most houseplants is small and has a very narrow spout. A bad watering can for houseplants is the big, 2- or 3-gallon, clunky one that you use outdoors in the garden, the one with the 3-inch-wide nozzle that has a couple dozen holes in it. Leave the clunky one in the garden and get a special one for your houseplants. It needs to be small and lightweight, with a narrow spout to control where the water goes. Stick the narrow nozzle of your little watering can down to the surface of the potting medium and pour the water on the medium, not the foliage. This is particularly important for African violets because their leaves are damaged if you drip water on them.", "In addition to their beauty, Chinese evergreens (Aglaonema, A. modestum, A. pictum) are undemanding; thus, they are widely grown in public spaces such as shopping malls, hospitals, and hotels. The plant's small size and proven ability to purify indoor air make it a perfect companion for the home and office as well. Crowns of deep green foliage-mottled, marbled, and painted with splashes of pale silvery green-are typical for these handsome, easy-to-grow plants. Some newer cultivars have bright red, pink, and creamy white markings on the leaves. Stems are short-it is the crown of beautiful foliage that gives the plant its height and width. Many older cultivars become 2 to 3 feet tall and wide as they mature, but newer cultivars are bred to be very short and compact, about 1 foot tall and wide. Stems can become trunk-like with age as the oldest leaves are shed. Leaf size and shape varies widely; typical leaves are 6 to 10 inches long and 3 to 4 inches wide, but some cultivars have very narrow foliage, only 1 to 2 inches wide. The inflorescence is a small, pale green, scoop-shaped spathe surrounding a finger-like spadix covered with tiny flowers. Female flowers near the base of the spadix form red berries after fertilization; This plant is toxic to people and pets and should be kept in an out-of-the-way place. Its tissues contain calcium oxalate crystals, and if leaves are chewed the crystals penetrate the soft tissues of lips, tongue, and throat, causing painful swelling, drooling, and vomiting. If you suspect a person or pet has ingested parts of this plant, or if a person or pet exhibits serious symptoms such as difficulty breathing, call your local emergency hotline, poison control center, or vet; As for common problem of this plant, watch for leaves changing color, scale insects, and bacterial leaf spot.", "Read the Introduction for the specifics of each recommendation. LOW OR MEDIUM LIGHT: Cultivars with darker green foliage do best near a north window. Those with lighter, more extensive variegation of the foliage need the brighter light of an east window with curtains to filter the light. All varieties do well under artificial light. Chinese evergreen is intolerant of direct sun. MODERATE TEMPERATURE: Daytime 70 to 80°F, nighttime 60 to 70°F. This plant is sensitive to cold air so avoid drafty locations and temperatures below 60°F. MODERATE WATER: Water whenever the top of the potting medium becomes dry to a depth of 1 inch. HUMIDITY: These plants tolerate moderately dry air very well. But if the air in your home is very dry, then mist your plant twice a week with a spray bottle of water on a mist setting, or use a handheld mister. POTTING MEDIUM: Use any good organic, well-drained, general-purpose potting soil that incorporates organic fertilizer, mycorrhizal fungi, and other beneficial microbes. FERTILIZER: Use any balanced organic fertilizer. Apply once a month through the growing season, every two months in winter. POTTING: When your plant needs up-potting, every two years or so, shift it to a container with a diameter 2 inches larger than the current pot. These plants prefer being a little rootbound. Re-potting can be done any time of year. PROPAGATION: Chinese evergreen is easy to propagate from stem tip cuttings.", "A big, bold, dramatic houseplant that makes a beautiful addition to any room, fiddle-leaf fig (Ficus lyrata) is easy to grow and low maintenance. You frequently see it as a large specimen plant or focal point in offices, malls, or other large public buildings that can provide sufficient indirect light. Full sun is far too intense for fiddle-leaf fig. When grown as a houseplant, this broadleaf evergreen tree does not produce fruit and rarely exceeds 8 to 10 feet. You can trim it to encourage side branches and develop a bushy, full, rounded look. Or you can trim off side branches and lower leaves to expose the trunk and encourage a tall, erect, tree-like shape. The big, handsome leaves are 15 inches long and 10 inches wide. Dark, glossy green and shaped like a lyre or violin ('fiddle'), the leaves have a leathery texture, prominent veins, and a wavy mar gin. The dwarf 'Little Fiddle' gets only 6 feet tall with leaves half the size of standard varieties. The variegated 'Ivonne', with leaves splashed in white and pale green, is spectacular; As for common problem of this plant, watch for leaf drop, spider mites , and leaf spot fungus.", "Read the Introduction for the specifics of each recommendation. MEDIUM LIGHT: Give fiddle-leaf fig bright, fil tered light and it grows fairly rapidly. It toler ates a couple hours of direct sun from an east window but direct sun all day long from a south window is too much for it. Filter the light (and heat) from a south or west window with sheer curtains or Venetian blinds. In too much shade it grows very slowly. MODERATE TEMPERATURE: Daytime 70 to 80°F, nighttime 60 to 70°F. MODERATE WATER: Water whenever the top of the potting medium becomes dry to a depth of 1 inch. HUMIDITY: Mist your fiddle-leaf fig twice a week with a spray bottle of water on a mist setting, or use a handheld mister. Put the pot in a saucer or tray of water, making sure the bottom of the pot never sits directly in the water by raising the pot up on pot feet or pebbles. Consider putting a humidifier in the room. POTTING MEDIUM: Use any good organic, well-drained potting soil that incorporates organic fertilizer, mycorrhizal fungi, and other beneficial microbes. FERTILIZER: Use any organic fertilizer, in either a powder or liquid formulation, where the first number (nitrogen) is higher than the other two. Apply dry fertilizer once in early spring and again in June. Apply liquid fertilizer at half-strength every two weeks in spring and summer. Stop feeding in fall and winter. POTTING: When fiddle-leaf fig needs up-potting, shift it to a container with a diameter 4 inches larger than the current pot. Up-pot again every year until it is as big as you want it to get. Keep it in a heavy ceramic pot to prevent it from toppling over.

There are two reasons to go small with containers. One is that small containers have a dwarfing effect on plant size, which is usually desirable under indoor conditions. Second, soil that is not employed in the service of roots tends to hold onto excess moisture, which in turn sets a tempting table for fungi that cause roots to rot; The diameter of the top of the pot (the measurement between opposite edges) is usually about the same as its depth.

When drainage is slow, roots are often forced to sit in water, which causes them to run short of oxygen and possibly rot. When drainage is very fast, roots may not have time to take up water before it disappears. How fast or slow a container drains depends on the size and number of drainage holes present in the bottom of the container and how well they are working, as well as on the texture of the potting medium and the density of plant roots. The size and shape of the container affects drainage, too. Tall, narrow containers tend to drain quickly near the top, though the bottom section of the container may still be very moist. Low, broad containers usually drain in a more uniform fashion; All houseplants require containers that have holes in the bottom through which excess water can escape, or drain away, yet they vary in their drainage requirements. Plants that grow best when they dry out between waterings - for example, most cacti and succulents, and some bromeliads and orchids - benefit from a planting system that provides fast drainage. Such a system is comprised of small containers with numerous drainage holes, filled with a very porous potting mix. Plants that prefer constant moisture around their roots fare better with moderate drainage, which is created by growing them in containers with fewer drainage holes and a dense, moisture-retentive potting mix; Your choice of container size and potting mix can be tailored to meet the needs of each plant, but with all plants it is important that the drainage holes remain open. The simplest way to do this is to line the bottoms of containers with a layer of coarse pebbles, shards of broken clay flowerpots or old dinner plates, or a few small stones, set so that water can flow around them and then out through the holes below. In addition to enhancing drainage, a loose layer of rocky fill keeps the potting medium from crumbling out through the bottoms of the pots. Small containers are fine with a thin layer of drainage material (or none at all), but larger pots need more help in the drainage department. In a 6-inch container, include 1 inch of rocky fill at the bottom, increasing to 2 inches in a 12-inch pot. To limit the weight of very large containers, you may include only 1 inch of rocky fill, covered with a couple of inches of foam packing peanuts; Gauge the depth of the layer of pebbles or broken crockery placed in the bottom of the container to the size of the pots.

Here are some fertilizer guidelines: 1. As a general rule, fertilize plants whenever they are actively producing new growth, which for most plants is spring to fall, when light levels are high. Plants kept under lights should also be fed in winter, but feeding plants that are resting in weak winter light can do more harm than good. 2. Feed plants when the soil is moist. Plants that have been stressed by dry soil conditions may take up more nutrients than they can use when fertilized before they have a chance to rehydrate roots, leaves, and stems. 3. Withhold fertilizer from newly purchased plants or plants that have been moved to a new place, because the task of adjusting to new conditions is difficult enough without the additional pressure to produce new growth. 4. As a broad general rule, wait at least 6 weeks after repotting plants in fertilizer-enriched soil before you begin feeding them again. Plants usually need no fertilizer for several weeks after they are repotted into potting soil that includes fertilizer. Most potting soils do include a bit of starter fertilizer, and it is best to allow plants time to make use of these nutrients before giving them additional food. Knowing when to begin feeding freshly repotted plants is part of the grower's art, because several factors influence the rate at which the plants use the fertilizer, including light, temperature, frequency of watering, size of the root mass, and overall growth rate of the plant.", "metadata": {"source": "The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual Essential Know-How for Keeping (Barbara Pleasant)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Care Instructions"}}, {"id": "houseplant(completeplants)_fertilizer_types", "title": "Houseplant Fertilizer - Three Type of Fertilizers", "content": "Choosing plant fertilizers. Feeding your plants need not be complicated. A few plants respond best to special fertilizers, but most houseplants are easily fed with a balanced house-plant food, a high-phosphorous houseplant food, or a high-nitrogen foliage plant food; The differences between these three types of fertilizer is based on the fertilizer analysis, which is represented by the three hyphenated numbers on the fertilizer label. These numbers stand for nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. Here is what each nutrient does: 1. NITROGEN, the first number, supports the production of new stems and leaves. Young plants and foliage plants benefit from plenty of nitrogen, which is especially important for foliage plants that are growing rapidly, as many do in spring and early summer. In addition to a high first number in the fertilizer analysis, high-nitrogen houseplant foods usually say something about 'foliage' plants on the label. 2. PHOSPHOROUS, the second number, is essential for all plants, but particularly important for flowering houseplants. Plants are encouraged to produce buds and blossoms by plant food rich in phosphorous. Many (but not all) African violet foods are high in phosphorous. When looking for a high-phosphorous food for blooming houseplants, look for an African violet food in which the middle number (phosphorous) is approximately twice as big as the first one (nitrogen): for example 1-3-2 or 8-14-9. Fertilizers with extremely high middle numbers are often called 'bloom start' fertilizers. These are more appropriate for using outdoors for feeding plants that are growing in open soil than for feeding houseplants. Because their roots are restricted to pots, even house-plants that grow best with a high-phosphorous fertilizer need a bit of balance in their diet. 3. POTASSIUM, the third number, improves the functioning of roots and supports plants' ability to move moisture and nutrients to all of their tissues. In balanced houseplant fertilizers, which are often called all-purpose plant foods, the three numbers are roughly the same, indicating a balance of the three major nutrients. The three most popular balanced houseplant foods show these nutrient analyses on their labels: 8-7-6, 6-5-6, and 20-30-20; other balanced fertilizers show analyses of 7-7-7, 20-20-20, and so forth.

As well as nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium, plants need small amounts of other nutrients, often called micronutrients. Micronutrients such as calcium, copper, iron, and magnesium are present in fresh, good-quality potting soils, but plants that are repotted infrequently benefit from plant foods that replenish their micronutrient supply. When buying houseplant fertilizer, try to choose a product that includes at least a short list of micronutrients; Don't discard a plant food because you see no micronutrients listed in the fine print, however. Magnesium can be provided by adding a pinch of Epsom salts to water, or you can mix up a micronutrient buffet by making compost tea. Buy a small amount of bagged compost at any garden center, swirl a gallon of it with 2 gallons/7. 5 liters of water, let it settle for an hour or so, and then pour off the brown 'tea' and use it to water your plants; Alternatively, you can filter the tea through a strainer lined with a paper towel, pour it into a pump spray bottle, and spray it onto plant leaves. Treating plants to compost tea twice a year, in spring and late summer, ensures that plants get all the micronutrients they need, along with naturally occurring enzymes, which often have an invigorating tonic effect on plants; Making compost tea can be messy, but there is an alternative. Look for micronutrient fertilizers that are mixed with water and sprayed onto plant leaves. These are sold at most garden centers (or by mail order). Many of these products are made from dried, powdered seaweed, or kelp. A few are rich sources of iron, which is often needed by azaleas, gardenias, and other plants that grow in acidic soil.

So far we've been discussing the chemical side of fertilizer, but you also have a choice of fertilizer forms - liquid concentrates, powders, crystals, tablets that dissolve in water, spikes that are pushed into the potting soil, or time-release fertilizers, which are coated granules that slowly release nutrients as they dissolve; For most plants, the best choice is a liquid or mix-with-water powder or crystal form, which gives you tight control over how much fertilizer goes into the pot. One is no better than another, though liquids dissolve very quickly, and do not clump or melt when exposed to high humidity as powders and crystals sometimes do. Both liquids and soluble powdered fertilizers are available as organic products, derived from natural materials, or you can use synthetic forms (plants don't seem to be able to tell the difference). Spikes are quite unpredictable, and should be used only when you anticipate a long absence when you must leave your plants in the hands of an inexperienced plant-sitter; Very large, long-lived houseplants such as palms, Norfolk pines, and others that grow into small trees can easily be fed by scratching 1-2 tsp/5 10 ml of coated time-release fertilizer into the top . 5 in/1. 25 cm of soil. You can also use a balanced organic fertilizer, which releases nutrients slowly as it decomposes. With either organic or time-release fertilizer, a small amount of fertilizer dissolves and moves down into the soil each time the plant is watered.

On their way to your home, the progeny spent weeks, months, or years in humid greenhouses. Compared to these settings, modern homes and offices are quite arid, especially in winter when heated air becomes extremely dry. When you take a plant that's accustomed to a very humid environment and force it to grow in dry air, it may not be able to adequately replenish moisture lost through its leaves. Leaf tips and edges may become dry and turn brown, or the plant may shed many of its leaves. Plants with thin leaves or those with long, strap-shaped foliage tend to suffer most from low levels of humidity; You always have a choice between altering indoor humidity to meet the needs of plants or changing your plant choices in keeping with prevailing humidity. Several ways of raising indoor humidity are described below, or you can stick with plants that adapt to low humidity, such as cacti and succulents. Another option is to grow plants that need high humidity in a terrarium - a perfect solution to providing a humid place for plants in dry offices, or for enjoying the company of plants if you suffer from numerous allergies. See page 323 for details on planting and caring for a terrarium; In winter, when indoor air is quite dry, group high-humidity-loving plants together on a pebble-lined tray that can be filled halfway with water. To further raise humidity, place glasses or bowls of water among the plants; Humidity means the amount of water vapor present in the air, and it is measured with an instrument called a hygrometer. But you do not need a hygrometer to know some basic things about prevailing humidity. Rooms in which water is often used, such as the bathroom and kitchen, tend to be more humid than other areas of the house. If you keep plants that crave high humidity, try to place them near sources of running water; Plants are constantly taking up moisture through their roots and releasing it through their leaves, so to some extent, they create their own humidity. In a study done at Washington State University, simply adding several plants to a computer lab increased humidity by about 10 percent while reducing the amount of dust floating in the air. However, plants that need high humidity cannot turn a very dry environment into a comfortably humid one without a little help. One very simple strategy for increasing humidity is to place plants close together, because groups of transpiring plants form pockets of humidity on their own. There is some natural symmetry here, in that we tend to fill our brightest indoor spots with closely spaced plants. Placing bowls or glasses of water between plants increases humidity while keeping water handy for dribbling into containers.", "metadata": {"source": "The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual Essential Know-How for Keeping (Barbara Pleasant)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Care Instructions"}}, {"id": "houseplant(completeplants)_humidity_extra", "title": "Houseplant Humidity - Extra Information", "content": "To further increase humidity, you can place plants on watertight trays filled with clean pebbles, which are then covered halfway with water. The water should not be so deep that it reaches the bottoms of the containers, which can cause roots to rot. The trays also need to be rinsed every few weeks to keep them from becoming a secret haven for fungus gnats or other pests. Regular cleaning also limits the amount of salts that accumulate on the pebbles as water evaporates; Misting plants, by spraying them with a fine spray of water, is helpful for plants that need unusually high humidity, but for some plants it can do more harm than good. Plants with hairy leaves, such as African violets, dry very slowly, and leaves that stay damp for long periods of time can develop problems with disease. However, a few plants, such as bromeliads, actually take up moisture through specialized scales on their leaves, so misting them accomplishes two things - the plants absorb moisture, and they enjoy increased humidity; Misting plants from time to time when the air is very dry is a sound practice, but you should not mist heavily without a specific purpose in mind. Do mist plants that are at high risk of developing problems with spider mites, which often follow on the heels of very dry conditions. Keep in mind that misting is not a substitute for a thorough rinse, which is the best preventive measure for this pest. Misting is also helpful in early winter, when humidity levels fall in keeping with an increase in indoor heating, or as a way to ease the adjustment of new plants that are accustomed to greenhouse conditions. Once plants have 2 to 3 weeks to adjust to such changes, it is best to allow humidity to gradually drop to levels that are comfortable for both you and your plants as opposed to continuous heavy misting. Most people and plants are comfortable in rooms where the humidity level ranges between 40 and 50 percent.

Because we humans run on food, we tend to think that plants depend on fertilizer (as 'food') in a very fundamental way. Certainly they do, but plants derive most of their energy from light. When deprived of light, the availability of nutrients and moisture is meaningless; Plants make use of light through the process known as photosynthesis. Special cells within the leaves, called chloroplasts, take in light and transform it into energy. It is a small stretch to regard all plants as solar collectors. They receive, process, and store up light in the form of leaves, stems, roots, and sometimes flowers; Plants that prefer high light contain numerous chloroplasts, which assemble into thick layers within the leaf tissues. The chloroplast layers within the leaves of low-light plants are comparatively thin. Yet plants can adapt to changing light levels by altering the density and arrangement of their chloroplasts. This happens naturally as light levels change with the seasons, or when available light changes because you move the plant to a lighter or darker location. When exposed to increased light, plants respond by lining up more chloroplasts so they can put to use a more abundant supply of light. When light is decreased, leaves let go of chloroplasts that are no longer needed; A robust Boston fern basks in the reflected light from white walls and furnishings; When deprived of sufficient light, plants naturally stretch toward the closest window; These changes do not happen overnight. Rather, adapting to changing light levels is a gradual process, which brings us to what is called acclimatization. When a plant is moved to a place where light conditions are different from the place it was before, it immediately begins making changes in its chloroplast structures, and other cells get in on the act as well. If the plant is not receiving enough light, it may twist and bend toward the light source in order to reorient its solar collectors (leaves) so they can collect every ray. This process, called phototropism, is also evident when stems lengthen as a plant stretches toward light. Some plants respond more dramatically, by shedding light-starved leaves. Ferns and ficus are famous for their tendency to shed leaves in response to a radical reduction in their light supply; On the other hand, if a plant accustomed to low light conditions is suddenly moved into bright light, its leaves may be so ill-prepared that they wither. Thin layers of chloroplasts are usually housed by thin leaves with meager moisture reserves. Houseplants can be damaged or killed when moved from dim to bright light if they are not given 2 to 4 weeks to adjust to the change - a common challenge when plants are moved outdoors for the summer. Leaves that are scorched by sudden exposure to bright sun seldom recover from the trauma; Keep these processes in mind as you discover or create the ideal light conditions for your plants. Finding the best spot in your house to grow a certain plant is a hunting expedition, but knowing the light preference of the plant, and where such light is likely to be found, simplifies the task. The light preferences of individual plants are given in the plant profiles in Parts 1 and 2.

Spaces near windows are logical places to grow houseplants. Natural sunlight includes a full spectrum of rays, and of course no electricity is needed to run a window. Large windows admit more light than small ones, but almost any window can accommodate some type of houseplant. Keeping windows clean is an easy way to maximize natural light. It also can help to trim limbs from outdoor trees and shrubs that block light as it enters your windows. If the light from unobstructed, squeaky clean windows proves insufficient, you can easily add supplemental light. Similarly, excessive natural light can be filtered through a sheer curtain, making it more acceptable to both plants and people; Get to know the compass orientation of your windows by watching where the sun rises (east) and where it sets (west). In North America, a southern exposure always offers the strongest light because the sun arcs from east to west from a slightly southern spot in the sky. The arc is lower in winter and higher in summer, so even indoors there is a remarkable seasonal difference in how much light comes through a south-facing window. As a general rule, it is best to reserve space near south windows for high-light plants; In the Northern Hemisphere, the sun's arc is much nearer to the southern horizon in winter, so north windows receive very little light. The sun's arc rises in summer, so all windows receive more light; Similar seasonal trends affect windows on the north side of your house. In summer, north-facing windows may provide enough light to grow low light houseplants, but in winter few plants are satisfied with the weak light in a northern exposure. Yet there are exceptions. Many blooming houseplants need a cool rest in winter, which can coincide with low-light conditions. If you have a room with a northern exposure that can be kept cool, at 55-60°F/13-16°C, it can become a valuable asset by providing space for resting cacti and other plants that need a cool, dry period of semi-dormancy. Should additional light be needed, you can use fluorescent fixtures, which give off very little heat; East windows typically get strong morning sun, while west windows are brightly lit from early afternoon until evening. Even low-light plants enjoy gentle morning sun, so east windows are often preferred places for plants that adapt to low to moderate light. Afternoon sun tends to be somewhat harsh and quite warm, so west windows are often good places for high-light plants that prefer warmer conditions; Natural light from windows is always directional, meaning it comes from one primary direction. Plants respond by turning toward the light, often changing into a lopsided shape. To support good posture in your plants, make a habit of turning them a quarter turn about once a week. Plants grown in oblong boxes or dish gardens can be turned halfway, so that the front and back are given equal opportunities to bask in directional light.", "metadata": {"source": "The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual Essential Know-How for Keeping (Barbara Pleasant)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Care Instructions"}}, {"id": "houseplant(completeplants)_lighting_interior_light", "title": "Houseplant Lighting - Interior Light", "content": "Increasing interior light.

In rooms with dark walls, good plant-growing space is limited to 12-24 inches or 30-60 cm from the windowpane, while rooms with light-colored walls can accommodate larger plants, or plants placed more than 24 in/60 cm feet from the window. Mirrors hung so that they reflect light from windows can help illuminate any room; In homes where good plant-growing windows are few, many plant lovers install a bump-out window with shelves in a south- or west-facing window, creating an ideal spot for houseplants. In addition to providing abundant light, such a window has the feel of a small greenhouse, and may help collect solar heat in winter that can be shared with the rest of the room; A plant shelf, in which fluorescent light is maximized by reflective hoods, is a practical way to meet the light needs of a large collection of houseplants.", "metadata": {"source": "The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual Essential Know-How for Keeping (Barbara Pleasant)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Care Instructions"}}, {"id": "houseplant(completeplants)_lighting_artificial_light", "title": "Houseplant Lighting - Artificial Light", "content": "Using artificial lights. The ultimate way to increase interior light is to use supplemental lighting, which may work other magic for your home or office. Spotlights used to coax large plants to grow lush and full can be situated for maximum drama, and often make rooms look larger in the process. A shelf bursting with lush foliage that basks beneath a suspended light fixture becomes a refreshing indoor focal point. In your office, perhaps you can use a tall, linear floor lamp outfitted with compact fluorescent bulbs to transform a dull corner into a haven for air-purifying houseplants. When considering supplemental lights intended to benefit your houseplants, expect to be pleasantly surprised by the clean warmth they bring to any room; There are many choices. Regular lightbulbs, called incandescent lights, can help supplement light a little, with two drawbacks. Incandescent lightbulbs give off heat, which may be undesirable for both you and your plants, and the light they provide is incomplete compared to natural light. Incandescent light is often called soft or 'warm' light because it includes more red rays than blue ones. This is why it flatters human complexions. Unfortunately, many houseplants, particularly foliage plants, prefer light with good saturation on the blue-to-green end of the spectrum; Even inexpensive under-counter fluorescent lights are useful for providing light to plants; This is exactly what you get with fluorescent light. Fluorescent light is a little short in red light waves, which is why it seems a bit 'green. ' But compared to incandescent bulbs, fluorescent lights offer a broader light spectrum, the tubes are a bit more durable and give off less heat, and they are more energy efficient. New 'compact fluorescent' bulbs (comprised of narrow, curved tubes) represent a huge advance in energy efficiency, requiring half the electricity of incandescent bulbs to put out the same amount of light. They also last much longer than incandescent bulbs. Compact fluorescent bulbs can be screwed into traditional lamps and light fixtures designed for incandescent bulbs, or they can be purchased as tubes that fit into tube-type light fixtures. In terms of the quality of light they provide, low heat output, energy efficiency, and long service life, compact fluorescent bulbs are well worth their cost, which is slightly higher than that of incandescent or traditional fluorescent bulbs; When using artificial lighting, experiment with the distance between the light source and your plants. High-light plants respond well to having lights only 4-6 inches or 10-15 cm away, while plants that accept medium or low light thrive when the light source is 8-12 inches or 20-30 cm from the topmost leaves. Whenever it is practical, a reflective hood placed over the light helps capture and reflect light that would otherwise be lost to plants. Most light fixtures designed for plants include a hood. When using an under-cabinet type light fixture, painting the mounting surface bright white has the same effect as a reflective hood; Plants that have been struggling to make do with too little light often respond dramatically to supplemental artificial light. Once a fixture proves its worth, you will probably want to put it on a timer, so that the lights are turned on and off at regular times each day. Twelve to fourteen hours of continuous light is best for most houseplants, which also need regular periods of darkness. Some blooming houseplants will not set buds unless they are exposed to 12-plus hours of continuous darkness.", "metadata": {"source": "The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual Essential Know-How for Keeping (Barbara Pleasant)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Care Instructions"}}, {"id": "houseplant(completeplants)_lighting_high_intensity_light", "title": "Houseplant Lighting - High-intensity Light", "content": "High-intensity lights. Commercial growers, and some plant collectors, use special fixtures called high-intensity lights to simulate exposure to strong sunshine. Often abbreviated as HID lights ('high-intensity discharge'), these fixtures are costly and may require special wiring to accommodate the draw they make on electric circuitry. They are also not very pretty, and most require a ballast box to boost the power supply going to them. Still, if you develop a passion for cacti or other plants that need very bright light, eventually you may want to invest in HID fixtures; There are two general types - metal halide and high-pressure sodium. Metal halide lights emit strong light at the blue end of the spectrum, so they are often used to encourage leafy growth of young plants. High-pressure sodium lamps do a better job of delivering red wavelengths, which encourage strong flowering. In commercial greenhouses, growers may use metal halide lights when blooming plants are young, and switch to high pressure sodium lights when plants enter their flowering phase; Both types of high-intensity lights are available from companies that provide equipment for hydroponic horticulture, which is the practice of growing plants in nutrient-enriched water that is continuously circulated around the plants' roots.

' Plants that bloom in spring often use lengthening days as an important cue to develop buds and flowers, while those that bloom in fall and winter do so in response to days that are getting shorter and nights that are getting longer. In some plants, the photoperiod is such a strong trigger to flowering that they will not bloom unless they are provided with appropriate photoperiods. This happens naturally when plants are grown outdoors in their native habitats, but indoors you may need to manage the balance of light and darkness to promote strong bloom. For example, several popular, winter-blooming houseplants such as holiday cactus, kalanchoes, and poinsettias bloom when they sense that days are becoming shorter; Rather than providing light to these 'short-day' plants, the key is to deprive them of light daily for 14 continuous hours. You can do this by placing them in a room where no lights are used at night, and covering them with cardboard boxes for an extra few hours each morning or evening. Or place them in a dark closet outfitted with lights and a timer that will turn the lights on for only 8-10 hours a day.

When houseplants are moved outdoors in the summer, a number of insects, including various caterpillars, earwigs, and other critters that are seldom seen indoors, may breakfast on plant leaves or buds. Taking appropriate precautionary steps when bringing plants in following their outdoor summer vacation, as outlined on page 291, will greatly reduce the likelihood that you will see insects on your houseplants; Yet a few insects, including the eight described in detail here, have no trouble colonizing plants that never move from the places you select for them. In alphabetical order, these include aphids, earwigs, fungus gnats, mealybugs, scale, spider mites, thrips, and whiteflies. On page 278 you will find five insecticides that can be safely used to treat insect problems on houseplant; The most common way for any of these insects to gain entry to your home or office is by hitching a ride on new plants, where they may be hidden in crevices, or there may be one or two microscopic eggs attached to the underside of a leaf. For this reason, many people keep new plants separated from others for 3 to 4 weeks, during which time any lurking insect problems have ample time to become apparent. Isolating plants does not mean that you need to keep them in a separate room. A distance of 10 ft/3 m or so is sufficient to keep minor insect populations from moving from one plant to another, because insects seldom seek new host plants when they are satisfied with the one they have; The diversity of species among houseplants also gives you a degree of protection from insect epidemics. The insects described here can infest a number of different plants, but insects vary in their ability to digest the juices of specific plants. For example, if you have a dish garden in which the English ivy becomes infested with spider mites, you may find that dieffenbachia grown only a few inches away remains unaffected. So, when you must take steps to control insects that turn up on a certain species, it is seldom necessary to subject all of your plants to washing or spraying. Do, however, watch neighboring plants closely. If a new outbreak is going to occur on a previously unaffected plant, it will usually do so within a month; In addition to looking for insects, look for what they leave behind, which is tactfully referred to as honeydew. Most insects that infect house-plants suck plant juices, and their excrement is usually this sticky liquid. Leaves that show shiny patches or the presence of a sticky residue on surfaces near plants are evidence of feeding by sucking insects including aphids, mealybugs, scale, and some other species. If the insects have been present on the plant for some time, the honeydew darkens to what is called sooty mold. Both honeydew and sooty mold can be cleaned off with warm, soapy water and a soft cloth, but controlling the insects that created the mess often requires more extensive efforts; Plants that have had more than half of their leaves damaged by insects are often not worth saving. However, if the plant can be propagated from a stem cutting and you find a stem that appears insect free, you can try rooting the cutting as described on page 299. This is often the best way to retain a beloved plant that has been ravaged by insects.", "metadata": {"source": "The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual Essential Know-How for Keeping (Barbara Pleasant)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Troubleshooting"}}, {"id": "houseplant(completeplants)_pests_aphids", "title": "Houseplant Pests - Aphids", "content": "Description: Where there is one aphid, there are many more, because these tiny sucking insects always appear in groups. They can hitch rides indoors on plants, people, or pets, and because female aphids are born pregnant, they quickly form colonies when they find a suitable host plant. Many plants can host aphids, which are most commonly found on tender young leaf tips, the undersides of new leaves, or the buds of blooming houseplants. Because aphids suck plant juices, infested stems and leaves often are curled or distorted; Most aphids are less than in /. 3 cm long, round or oval in shape, with colors that range from green to yellow to red. Some aphids develop wings, while others do not. When many aphids feed on a plant, they leave behind a sticky residue that makes leaves shiny and often causes gummy specks to form on tabletops and floors beneath infested plants; Aphids are usually found in dense colonies, feeding on tender new growth at stem tips. Pinch off heavily infested stems before trying other control measures. Control: Fortunately, aphids are not difficult to control. The first thing to do is clip off stem tips that are heavily infested. If only a few aphids are present, you can remove them with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol. For more serious infestations on large plants, clean the plants thoroughly in a lukewarm shower or take them outdoors and spray them with a fine spray from the hose. The spray will dislodge many aphids, though some will survive hidden away in leaf crevices. You can get these stowaways by repeating the procedure after a few days. Very small plants can be cleaned by dipping them in a sink of soapy water after first enclosing the container and soil in a tightly wrapped plastic bag. Insecticidal soap kills aphids quickly and easily, so it is a good idea to make a practice of spraying all plants kept outdoors in summer with a dilute soap spray before you bring them indoors in the fall.", "metadata": {"source": "The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual Essential Know-How for Keeping (Barbara Pleasant)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Troubleshooting"}}, {"id": "houseplant(completeplants)_pests_cyclamen_mites", "title": "Houseplant Pests - Cyclamen Mites", "content": "Description: ANOTHER MITE PEST, much smaller than spider mite, sometimes causes leaves and flowers of African violets, begonias, cyclamens, and gloxinias to become dwarfed and distorted.

It is a fact that earwigs are attracted to the cool dampness on the undersides of flower pots. They are most often seen on plants shifted outdoors in summer, but sometimes earwigs sneak indoors and find safe havens beneath houseplant containers. Earwigs rarely cause serious damage to plants, though they will eat roots and leaves rather than starve to death; A cigar-sized roll of damp newspaper placed next to plants is an easy way to capture earwigs, which are most active at night. Control: Indoor conditions are usually too dry for earwigs, so they do not reproduce indoors. You can gather them with a vacuum cleaner if you don't want to touch them, or you can trap them. Roll a piece of newspaper into a hollow, cigarsized roll held tight with rubber bands, dampen it well, and place it where earwigs have been seen. At night, the earwigs will crawl inside the tube, and you can dispose of it first thing in the morning.

Often fungus gnats sneak indoors through open doors or windows and then breed in the damp soil of houseplant containers. Adults may lay 300 eggs at a time, which hatch a week later into tiny, threadlike larvae. The larvae feed on rotting vegetation in the soil as well as on tiny plant roots. After feeding for 2 weeks, they pupate into adults. Plants growing in severely infested soil appear weak, grow poorly, and often shed older leaves. Control: The first thing to try is to allow the soil to dry out between waterings, because fungus gnats need constant moisture. If problems persist, try trapping the adults and larvae. Adults are attracted to yellow sticky traps placed near lights. Attach a piece of yellow plastic or poster board to a wooden skewer or stick, coat it with petroleum jelly, and install it in an infested houseplant placed near a lamp, like a gnat-catching flag. An old remedy for trapping the larvae involves pushing slices of raw potato into the soil, which attract the larvae. Gather the potato pieces and dispose of them every 2 days.

Mealybugs are experts at hiding in small nooks where leaves join stems, and some species feed on plant roots. Adult mealybugs are ⅛-⅜ in/. 2-. 9 cm across, and look like whitish cottony blobs, which loosely attach themselves to stems, leaves, or roots. They weaken plants by sucking plant juices. The white coating on the adults, nymphs, and eggs protects them from sprays with water or pesticides, so the best way to control them is by hand; Mealybugs are easily removed by hand. Use a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol, which usually kills the uncollected mealybugs. Or, pick them from plant stems and leaves with tweezers. Control: Begin by using a fingernail, toothpick, or cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol or vegetable oil to dislodge and collect all the mealybugs you can find. Pay close attention to the places where leaves are attached to stems, which is a favorite place for mealybugs to hide. Repeat this procedure weekly until the plant is free of mealy-bugs. If the plant tolerates insecticidal soap, a thorough spray will often kill any mealybugs you missed. African violets, cacti, and some other house-plants are attacked by mealybugs that feed on plant roots. Sometimes you can find root-feeding mealybugs on the bottom of the pots, or you can allow the roots to dry a bit and then tap the plant out to inspect its roots. If mealybugs are present, gently repot the plant in clean soil and then take it outdoors and drench the roots (but not the leaves) with an insecticide such as carbaryl. When any type of mealybug problem develops in greenhouses, a natural predator called the mealybug destroyer is often released, and it does a good job of hunting down and killing mealybugs.

Most species are exclusively female. When males do occur, they do not have mouths, and therefore live but for a short time. Once a juvenile scale attaches itself to a leaf or stem with its needlelike mouthparts, it seldom moves. Instead, it grows larger, exudes a waxy coating that forms a helmetlike shell, and bears hundreds of young, all in one place; Several species of scale infest houseplants, including a few that normally live on outdoor trees and shrubs in mild climates. Others are tropical species that inhabit greenhouses where houseplants are grown commercially. Wherever they come from, scales are formidable houseplant pests. They can infest hundreds of different types of plants, but tend to be most troublesome on ficus and ferns; The evidence of scale infestation is easy to detect. Affected leaves or stems may be weak and slightly yellow, and there is often a sticky substance on the table or floor beneath the plants. This is honeydew excreted by the scale as they feed on plant juices. Most scale are found on stems or leaf undersides, especially near the central leaf vein. They may be brown, gray, or black bumps, which are often shaped like flattened discs. Fully grown adults range from -⅛ in/. 2-. 4 cm in diameter. Juvenile scales, called crawlers, do move about, but they are so small that they are very difficult to see; Use a soft cloth dipped in warm, soapy water to remove scale from leaves and stems. Control: Practice prevention of this pest by thoroughly cleaning any ferns or ficus that spend the summer outdoors before moving them back indoors for the winter. Treating plants with insecticidal soap a week or two before they are brought indoors is an excellent preventive practice. Some ferns are damaged by soap, so test a sample frond before treating the entire plant; Should you discover scale on any houseplant, your first line of defense is to attempt to clean it by hand using a soft cloth dipped in warm, soapy water. Although this is laborious, it is worthwhile if the infestation is light and you value the plant. On cactus and other untouchable plants, use a cotton swab dipped in soapy water or oil to remove scale; After removing as many scales as you can, treat the plants with insecticidal soap, and then place them in a shady place to rest. Another option is to use horticultural oil, which smothers scale insects. Whether you use soap or oil, repeat the application 10 days later to kill scales that may have escaped the first treatment. If you tried to clean away scale by hand and were unsuccessful, you will probably have better luck after you have given the plants a thorough spray with insecticidal soap. You'll find that dead scale are easier to remove than live ones; Several chemical insecticides can be used on scale that persists despite treatment with insecticidal soap or oil and hand cleaning, but be sure to check a sample leaf first to make sure that the plant can tolerate the chemical. Soap sprays cannot be used on palms, so when a large palm becomes infested with scale, a systemic insecticide containing imidacloprid is often the best solution.", "metadata": {"source": "The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual Essential Know-How for Keeping (Barbara Pleasant)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Troubleshooting"}}, {"id": "houseplant(completeplants)_pests_spider_mites", "title": "Houseplant Pests - Spider Mites", "content": "Description: Perhaps the most dreaded pests of houseplants, spider mites are not true insects, but are more closely related to spiders and ticks. Spider mites damage plants by piercing the leaves with needle-sharp mouthparts and then sucking out plant juices. They congregate on the undersides of plant leaves, where they may not be seen until the plant is seriously infested. Mite-laden leaves may show numerous yellow pinpricks, or they may be dry and limp while still green. Left uncontrolled, spider mites can kill their first victim and then spread to other nearby plants; Spider mites cannot hurt people or pets, however, because they are so very tiny. Most adults are only in/. 05 cm long, so you would need a 15× magnifying glass to see them. Under magnification, spider mites may be green, yellow, red, black, or colorless. Without a magnifying glass, you can usually see faint silky webbing on the undersides of badly infested leaves. Also, if you tap or brush the underside of an infested leaf over a white piece of paper, you may be able to see miniscule moving dots. Control: Spider mites usually gain entry to homes and offices on new plants, so it's always a good idea to keep new plants isolated from others for a couple of weeks. In dish gardens, sometimes one plant will have spider mites, but the others will be okay. This is usually because the infested plant was stressed in some way, which left it easy prey for the mites. Weak plants have more problems with spider mites than healthy ones; Early detection is a challenge, but light infestations of spider mites are much easier to treat than severe ones. Spider mites multiply rapidly, with eggs hatching only 3 days after they are laid. A complete life cycle, from egg to egg-laying adult, can pass in only 2 weeks. Very dry conditions encourage spider mites, so they are often seen in winter, when plants struggle in dry, heated rooms. Misting plants regularly or setting them on beds of pebbles that are kept damp helps to prevent problems with spider mites; Early control is crucial with spider mites, which can infest a broad range of houseplants. By the time you see faint webbing on leaf undersides, the mite population is dangerously high; How you control spider mites depends on the size and value of the affected plant, and how much you want to keep it. Small, inexpensive plants that have come into your life casually are best disposed of, because in the time it takes to bring the mites under control they could spread to more significant houseplants. However, if only some parts of the plant are infested, promptly clip them off and dispose of them in a sealed plastic bag. Then treat the remainder of the plant with insecticidal soap or the soap-oil spray described on page 275. Repeat at least twice at 5-day intervals to make sure you kill new mites that hatch from eggs hidden in leaf crevices or beneath bits of webbing; Do not attempt to control spider mites with pesticides. They often do not work, and mites rapidly become resistant to them. If you have a very large collection of houseplants that are affected by spider mites, you might consider releasing beneficial mite predators to bring spider mites under control. This solution is often used in greenhouses, and it is very effective.

Adults look like dark-colored shards or bits of thread, while young thrips are usually yellowish brown. Thrips feed on both leaves and flowers. Leaves that are infested with thrips often show silvery streaks where the thrips rasp into leaf tissue before inserting their strawlike mouthparts to suck plant juices. When an infestation is severe, the leaf may pucker or curl around the thrips, and you often can see sprinklings of black feces, which look like finely ground black pepper.

If you then use a magnifying glass to inspect leaf undersides, you may find barely visible eggs, crawlers (larvae), and pupae, all of which are very tiny and yellowish in color. Infested leaves are often pale and drooping from having their juices removed by feeding whiteflies; Whiteflies that infest houseplants can feed on more than 60 species of plants.

Early intervention is important, because whiteflies reproduce and spread quickly. A complete life cycle can pass in only 40 days. Control: Begin treatment by removing badly infested leaves, which probably will not recover from the feeding done by these sucking insects anyway. Then rinse the plant thoroughly, and follow up with a spray of insecticidal soap if the plant can tolerate soap sprays. Very delicate plants can be sprayed with a mixture of 4 parts water to 3 parts rubbing alcohol. Repeat this treatment every 7 to 10 days to make sure that no whiteflies survive; Whiteflies feed by sucking plant juices, so infested leaves often appear pale or limp; Once you have had whiteflies, it's a good idea to monitor all plants for several months by using yellow sticky traps.

SOAP SPRAYS AND DIPS, or gently wiping leaves with warm, soapy water, is the least toxic way to control most houseplant insects. Soap controls insects by coating them with fatty acids. It has no residual effect, so repeat applications often are needed.

While dishwashing liquids may do a good job, they can also pose risks, since they include fragrances, antibacterial agents, and other chemicals that may damage plant leaves. Never use laundry detergent or detergents made for use in dishwashers in homemade plant sprays, because they are much too harsh for plants; A few plants are sensitive to soap. If plants droop a few hours after being sprayed with a soap solution, immediately rinse them off with lukewarm water. Never allow plants that have been sprayed with soap to sit in bright sun. Soap sprays may temporarily interfere with the protective cutin layer on leaf surfaces, making them more susceptible to leaf scorch. 4. PESTICIDES that are placed in the soil and then taken up by plants are called systemic pesticides, because they introduce a toxin into the entire plant system. Insects that feed on treated plants are poisoned as they take in the plant's juices. Systemic pesticides are an effective way to treat scale problems that do not respond to simpler strategies, and they are sometimes used to control other sucking insects, too. However, when you use a systemic pesticide, you are bringing a toxic substance into a closed indoor environment. It is therefore important to read the product's label carefully. Older systemic pesticides often used as their active ingredient disulfoton, which is extremely toxic. Most newer products are based on imidacloprid, which is much less toxic to people, earthworms, and birds. It is included in some potting soils and combination ready-to-use pest control sprays that are safe to use indoors. Read the label, because concentrated forms of imidacloprid-based pesticides should be applied outdoors rather than indoors. Move the plant outdoors for treatment, and allow the spray to dry completely before bringing the plant back inside. Also remember that systemic pesticides should never be used on edible plants. 5.

It is also gratifying to propagate plants to share, and sometimes you may want to launch into a propagation project out of a sense of adventure. When you see roots emerging from stems looking for a place to go, or when you're pruning off stem tips to improve a plant's shape, it is fun to go to the next step and grow a new plant; Understanding the botanical processes behind the transformation from stem or leaf to a nicely rooted new plant makes propagation less mystifying. In the course of normal growth, plants develop specialized cells that become roots, stems, leaves, and flowers. Along with these purposeful cells, plants lay down a safety cache of more versatile cells, which can morph into specialized cells should the plant's welfare be threatened. An excellent example is what happens when you propagate a new plant from the base of an African violet leaf. The base of the leaf stem, or petiole, is stocked with cells capable of developing into roots and leaf buds, and if conditions are right, this is exactly what happens; With all plants, the art of successful propagation involves coaxing these latent cells to action. The individual plant's anatomy will suggest to you the best method to try; these anatomical features and the propagation methods that best suit them are discussed in detail in the following pages. Consult the plant profiles in Parts 1 and 2 as well to learn the best propagation methods for individual species. The six most common methods of propagating houseplants - rooting stem cuttings, rooting petiole leaf cuttings, simple layering, air layering, division, and seeds - are described in detail in the following pages; None of these methods is extremely difficult, though patience is often required. And, although you may occasionally propagate a plant as an emergency measure to save its life, it is always best to get plants into the best possible condition before propagating them. If you want to propagate a plant that has been neglected, give it a few weeks of regular water, fertilizer, and appropriate light before beginning the propagation process; As for timing, there are many exceptions, but spring is usually the best season to undertake propagation projects. Houseplants respond to the long, sunny days of spring and summer by producing new stems and leaves, so plants propagated in spring have the best opportunity to make fast, steady new growth. Propagate flowering houseplants when they are not in bloom, because plants in flowering mode are controlled by hormones that tell the plant to channel its resources toward the production of buds and blossoms, usually at the expense of new foliar growth; MOST HOUSEPLANT GROWERS rarely, if ever, grow new plants from seed, but learning the basics of other means of propagation - especially rooting stem cuttings and division - is often necessary to prolong the lives of beloved plants. There are houseplants that are nearly impossible to propagate at home (for example, Norfolk pine and some palms), but most other houseplants need their keepers to take appropriate action when they become overgrown or are in need of a new mass of roots.

You also can root sections of the stem other than the tips. This is often done with plants that develop canelike stems or that have stems liberally endowed with nodes, such as rosemary. Whether you are working with stem tips or stem sections, the places that will develop new roots and leaves are the nodes - the places where the leaves attach to the stems. Nodes contain a good supply of cells that can grow into roots if needed to ensure the plant's survival; The growth of these cells can be stimulated by plant hormones, called auxins, which are readily available in rooting powder. All garden centers sell rooting powder, usually packaged in small plastic jars. Stem cuttings that are set to root must quickly develop roots or they rot, and using rooting powder greatly increases the chances that the former, rather than the latter, will occur. With remarkably willing rooters, such as Swedish ivy, rooting powder is not necessary; Rotting is also less likely if the cuttings are set into a medium that does not support the growth of fungi. Three such mediums are seed-starting mix, which is usually comprised of vermiculite and peat moss; plain perlite; or a half-and-half mixture of peat moss and sand. A few plants prefer one medium over another, but most plants root equally well in any of the three.", "metadata": {"source": "The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual Essential Know-How for Keeping (Barbara Pleasant)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Care Instructions"}}, {"id": "houseplant(completeplants)_propagation_stem_cuttings_procedure", "title": "Houseplant Propagation - Stem Cuttings Procedure", "content": "The procedure for stem cuttings is simple, but success is never guaranteed. It's a good idea to stick more cuttings than you need, because some of them may fail when microorganisms enter the cutting. Most plants with soft, fleshy stems root best when the cutting is set to root immediately after being taken from the parent plant, but succulents and semi-succulent plants sometimes root better if the cut surface is allowed to callus for one to several days before it is set to root; After the third week of stem cuttings, take off the plastic cover, but continue to mist the cuttings daily and keep them out of bright light. Remove and dispose of any cuttings that have obviously died (the stems will be black or shriveled). By the third week, you may see signs of new growth in some of the cuttings. If so, move them to a place where they will get a little more light, and begin mixing a small amount of fertilizer into the water used to replenish the moisture in the containers; Most stem cuttings will begin to root in 3 to 4 weeks, but some plants may need 2 months or more before they are ready to be potted into regular potting soil. Use the appearance of new growth as your guide. You can also test for the presence of roots by gently pulling on the cutting. A bit of resistance means that roots have anchored the cutting in the rooting medium. Ideally, stem cuttings set to root in late spring will show obvious new growth by midsummer, at which time they can be transplanted to small containers filled with an appropriate potting soil. Rapidly growing rooted cuttings may need to be repotted again after a few months. The following is the procedure of stem cuttings: 1. Cleanliness counts when handling cuttings. Wash your hands before filling small, clean containers with your medium of choice, dampen the medium well, and use a chop-stick or skewer to make holes for the cuttings. 2. Sterilize a sharp knife or pair of scissors by dipping it in boiling water for several seconds. Allow your cutting instrument to cool before severing a healthy stem just below a node. 3. Remove all but the topmost leaves from the cutting. Dip the cut end in water, then dip it in rooting powder, tap off the excess, and poke it into its prepared hole. (To avoid contaminating the rooting powder in its original container, pour out the amount you'll need into a small saucer or cup, then dispose of any excess. ) 4. Use your fingers to make sure the medium is in good contact with the stem. 5. For the first 2 weeks after setting any type of cuttings to root, enclose them in a plastic bag, container and all, and place them where they will receive no direct sunlight. A plastic bag or other humidity chamber is needed because, until they develop roots, the cuttings have no way to replenish moisture lost through the leaves. A translucent plastic bag held aloft with sticks works great for individual containers, or you can place several containers together in a small box and cover the top with a piece of plastic. 6. Each morning, remove the plastic and lightly mist the cuttings. In warm weather, check them again in the afternoon. Add water to the containers only if the medium appears to be drying out.

These include African violets, peperomias, rex begonias, piggy-back plants, and numerous succulents. The leaf stem, or petiole, is actually the plant part that develops roots. The procedure is similar to that used to root stem tip cuttings. Root several leaves, because not all of them will root successfully;Check the cuttings daily to make sure the rooting medium has not dried out. If necessary, spray the cuttings and rooting medium with lukewarm water to maintain constant light moisture; Petiole leaf cuttings usually root in 3 to 4 weeks. It then takes another month or so for small plantlets to form above the mass of new roots. When a plantlet has more than three leaves, it can be gingerly transplanted to a little pot, and the parent leaf may be snipped away and discarded. From this point on, plantlets will grow a little faster if a small amount of plant food is added to the water used to keep the growing medium moist; Here is the procedure to remove petiole: 1. Choose healthy, medium-sized leaves rather than very large or very small ones. Using a sterilized knife or scissors, trim the petiole if necessary to make it 1-2 inches or 2. 5-5 cm long. There is no need to trim succulent leaves, in which the leaf and petiole are merged into a single structure. However, you may need to let leaves taken from succulents dry overnight before setting them to root. 2. Fill a clean, shallow container with dampened seed-starting mix, perlite, or a half-and-half mixture of peat moss and sand. Plant the prepared leaves diagonally, so the ends of the petioles are buried only about 1/2 inches or 1. 25 cm deep. 3.

Spider plant provides an obvious example, with its habit of developing plantlets at the end of arching stems, each equipped with woody root buds. Other houseplants that have stems long enough to bend over and secure into a pot can reproduce in a similar way if given a little help. The big advantage of simple layering over rooting stem tip cuttings is that the cutting remains attached to the parent plant until roots have begun to grow. If you have tried rooting stem tip cuttings from a plant and failed, simple layering may prove to be a more successful method; Here's how to do it: 1 (Pinch off leaves attached to node). Position a small container filled with dampened rooting medium in a place where a stem can be secured. Ideally, the part of the stem to be layered should be a node 2-3 inches or 5-7. 5 cm down from the stem's tip. Identify the section of stem that will be buried and pinch off any leaves attached to that node. 2 (Secure the stem with a wire pin). Wound the area right around the node by scratching off the outer tissue with your fingernail or by making a tiny cut that goes not quite halfway through the stem. This wound will cue the plant to mobilize into survival mode. Dust the wound lightly with rooting powder and secure it in place with a stone or piece of wire bent into a U. For the next few weeks, keep the buried section of stem lightly moist. 3 (Sever the layered cutting from the parent plant). After 3 weeks or so, you can sever the layered cutting from the parent plant and treat it as you would a rooted stem tip cutting, or allow the layered stem more time to grow roots. If the stem seems lazy at this task of growing roots, a second wounding of the layered stem, 1 inch above the soil, may help it get started.", "metadata": {"source": "The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual Essential Know-How for Keeping (Barbara Pleasant)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Care Instructions"}}, {"id": "houseplant(completeplants)_propagation_air_layering", "title": "Houseplant Propagation - Air Layering", "content": "Like simple layering, air layering coaxes a stem to develop roots while it is still attached to the parent plant. This method is most appropriate for upright plants, such as schefflera. Air layering is the best method to use when propagating upright plants that have become top-heavy or outgrown their space; In air layering, rooting medium is attached to the plant stem, which is severed and treated like a rooted stem tip cutting after roots have begun to form. Although air layering takes time (usually 4 to 12 weeks), it is often surprisingly successful with tall, leggy plants. With some plants, you can air layer a primary stem, and after it is removed and transplanted to its own container, new secondary stems will emerge farther down the plant; As with other propagation methods, the first step is to identify a place on the plant where latent root cells are likely to be present. Nodes where leaves attach are best, including the scarred areas left behind after old leaves are shed. However, do choose a spot with healthy green tissue over stem areas that have gone woody with age. And, because the stem will eventually be cut away as if it were a stem tip, it's best if there are only a few leaves growing above the air layering site. A scant supply of new roots is incapable of supporting a large number of leaves; Here is the procedure to do this: 1. Once you have selected the place on the stem where you want a new tuft of roots to grow, remove any leaves that are present. 2. Lightly wound the stem with a clean, sharp knife, cutting no more than a third of the way through the stem. 3. Dust the wound lightly with rooting powder and then wrap the wound with a 'bandage' or dressing made from damp sphagnum moss (stringy, unmilled peat moss). 4. Cover it with plastic wrap and tape wrap in place with electrical or fabric bandage tape. You can also use clean potting medium packed into a small plastic bag firmly taped to the stem. 5. With either type of rooting pocket, leave a small opening in the top of the dressing where water can be added. Once the dressing is secure, add a few drips of water every few days to keep the moss or soil lightly moist. 6. Most air-layered plants begin producing roots in about a month, but wait until you see roots forming inside of the plastic to remove the dressing. When new roots are 2 inches or 5 cm long, cut the rooted section from the plant, remove the dressing, pot it up in clean potting soil, and treat it like a newly rooted stem cutting. Slowly increase light and fertilizer as new growth begins to appear.

With most plants, division is a rather straightforward operation, consisting of teasing plants apart with your fingers and then using a clean knife or pruning shears to separate entangled clusters of roots. With others, such as tree philodendron, adjoining crowns are held close by thick, woody roots that must be sawn apart with a small saw or stout serrated knif; Since it is important to injure as few roots as possible, the best way to do this is to submerge the plant in a tub or dishpan filled with lukewarm water, where old potting soil can be gently floated away and roots can be untangled while well lubricated with water. When roots are so tight and tangled that you can't see what you're doing, feeling your way along with the root ball submerged in water makes the job easier; Begin at the outside of the clump, dividing off crowns that are far from the mother clump. If the roots are so tangled or tightly attached that they will not come apart, it's best to grit your teeth and cut through the roots with a sharp serrated knife. As a general rule of thumb, it is best to divide a crowded clump into halves. If desired, the halves can be cut in half again. Pot up the divided clumps, planting them at the same depth that they grew in their original container. Expect to see some shriveling of leaves in the days that follow. Trim off these damaged leaves close to the base, and allow the plant a little time to adjust to its new independence. If the plant does not show good vigor after a couple of months, take it up from the pot so that you can remove bits of decayed roots that were damaged when the plant was divided, then repot; When thick roots make it impossible to pull plants apart, cut through the root mass with a serrated knife; When dividing plants, soaking the roots in a pan of water often makes it easier to separate tangled roots; WHEN PROPAGATING PLANTS with variegated leaves, try division first, because rooted stem cuttings sometimes lose their variegation patterns and never recover them; SOME PLANTS ARE SO SLOW OR DIFFICULT to propagate using traditional methods that they are multiplied as test tube-grown clones. This process, called tissue culture, involves growing a new plant from a few cells placed in a special growing medium. When the tiny plantlets develop roots, they are transplanted to little wedges of soil, called plugs, which are then shipped to greenhouse growers to 'finish. ' The tissue-culture process sometimes affects the shape of the plant, which is more likely to have basal branches than plants propagated by other means.", "metadata": {"source": "The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual Essential Know-How for Keeping (Barbara Pleasant)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Care Instructions"}}, {"id": "houseplant(completeplants)_propagation_seeds", "title": "Houseplant Propagation - Seeds", "content": "Any plant that produces blooms eventually produces seeds, and seeds are the primary way that many houseplants propagate themselves when grown in the wild. However, because of insufficient pollination, seeds produced by indoor-grown plants may not be viable. And if the plants that produced the seeds are hybrids, the plants grown from the seeds will not be of the same quality and vigor of their parents. It is therefore not a good idea to save seeds from your own houseplants. However, you may want to try to grow some houseplants from high-quality purchased seeds; This is usually a very slow process, and the vegetative propagation methods described above are always faster than starting from seed. Still, it can be done. Cacti, African violets, and even palms all can be grown from seed. Most young seedlings require very bright light, so do not attempt to grow plants from seed unless you have a greenhouse or a supplemental light fixture that can be suspended 2 inches or 5 cm from the tops of the plants; The process itself is simple. Fill clean containers with damp seed-starting mix, and sow the seeds so they are covered to three times their diameter. Enclose the planted containers in loose plastic bags to create a moist, humid environment, and watch for the first emergence of tiny green sprouts. As soon as seeds germinate, move the containers to very bright light, and keep the planting medium lightly moist. The first leaves that emerge are often very simply shaped, but these seedling leaves soon give way to 'true' leaves, which resemble those of a mature plant. When seedlings have more than three true leaves, gently transplant them to individual containers; SOME PLANTS COME TO US in crowded clumps that result when greenhouse growers plant several rooted cuttings together in a pot so that it appears lush and full. This is often done with jade plants and holiday cacti, as well as numerous other species. To give the plants room to grow, they must eventually be separated and replanted into individual containers. Follow the directions under Division on page 306 for implementing simple separations.

It is always best to prune when plants are actively growing, though light trimming can be done at any time of year. Most plants that have lost their shape or are holding onto unhealthy branches are candidates for some type of pruning; Before you take up your pruning shears (or scissors, which often work equally well), take a moment to study the natural shape of the plant and how and where it develops new growth. Many plants produce new growth from the tips of stems and branches. The tip of the stem is called the dominant bud. Farther down the stem, there are usually latent buds located at the nodes - the places where leaves are (or once were) attached to the stem. As long as the dominant bud, or growing tip, is intact, it sends chemical signals down the stem that tell the latent buds to remain at rest. When the dominant bud is pruned, this signal is turned off, and latent buds spring to action and begin to grow; When pruning cuts are made just above a node, new stems will emerge from the latent node; Bearing this in mind, try to make your pruning cut 1/8 - 1/4 inches 0. 3-0. 6 cm above a node or other branch junction. To keep a plant bushy and full, prune some branches 'hard', cutting close to the base of the plant, and allow other branches to remain longer. Few plants benefit from a severe crew cut, though very vigorous houseplants such as geraniums and Swedish ivy respond well to aggressive pruning in the spring; Most often, you will be doing light pruning to help plants grow into nicely balanced shapes or to snip off old blossoms from flowering house plants. With many blooming plants, removing flowers as soon as they begin to fade encourages the plants to bloom again. If reblooming is not possible, trimmed plants will usually channel their energy toward the production of new leaves; Some plants, such as Norfolk pine and most palms, cannot be pruned from the top, because they have no secondary buds. With these plants, keeping containers small helps control the size of the plants so pruning is not needed, except to remove unsightly old leaves. When plants become too large, it is best to find them a new home roomy enough to accommodate them; Many people prune plants just before repotting them or prior to giving them a good cleaning. Be careful when watering pruned plants, because they need less water when they have fewer leaves to support.

Some plants can go years between repottings, while others need to be repotted at least once a year; Check mature plants yearly for signs that they are in need of repotting. At other times, if a plant shows one of the above symptoms, remove it from its container and examine the condition of the roots. When you see mostly roots and very little soil in the bottom half of the pot, repotting is probably in order. If the roots appear to have plenty of room to grow, pop the plant back into its pot and don't bother to repot; The best time to repot any plant is when it is entering its most active season of new growth. For most houseplants this is spring, but some grow year-round, and others grow vigorously in fall or winter and rest in summer. Repotting is messy, so it's great to be able to do it outside in spring, summer, or fall; Sometimes you may have an accidental opportunity to repot a plant out of season - for example, if it gets knocked to the floor or mangled by a pet. It is also not unusual to be surprised by the amount of new growth plants produce when they are kept outside during the summer. When you bring a plant indoors in the fall, you suddenly realize that the plant deserves roomier quarters if it is to prosper during the winter months. When you must repot a plant out of season, disturb the roots as little as possible, because full recovery from the event may be weeks or months away; Plants that have been troubled by disease or poor growing environments are seldom saved by repotting, which is often so stressful that it adds to a plant's demise. Sometimes healthy plants respond to repotting by showing a fast spurt of new vigor, but it is also typical for repotted plants to sulk for a while as they adjust to their new container. Do not be alarmed if a plant sheds a few leaves in the weeks after it is repotted. This is a form of self pruning, as the plant helps itself reach a good balance of roots and leaves.

If possible, cover a table or other waist-high work surface with newspapers or plastic sheeting. You can repot plants sitting on the ground, but the project will be easier on your back if you can work on a raised work surface. If you have trouble lifting heavy containers, get some help like two-person repotting. No plant is worth a permanent orthopedic injury; Here is the procedure of repotting: 1. Prepare plants to be repotted by thoroughly watering them a day or two ahead of time. Water again just before removing the plant from its old pot, because water acts as a lubricant, which is much needed when roots are tightly bound in the container. 2. Tap the container to loosen the plant. If the plant can be picked up, you can knock the pot sharply against a table edge or other hard surface. With very large pots, it's more practical to tip the pot and knock against the high side with a rubber mallet, knife handle, or other blunt object. Regardless of the pot's size, make repeated blows to all sides of the pot. The idea is to break adhesions that often develop between roots, old potting medium, and the inside surface of the container. Pliable plastic pots can often be smashed slightly to squeeze the plant from its moorings. 3. Lay the plant on its side and see if it will jiggle free without your having to pull hard on the main stem (always a no-no). If it is still stuck tight, use a knife to cut around the inside of the pot, the same way you might loosen a cake from a pan. Next, try to push the plant out from the bottom by poking upward through the drainage holes with a pencil or screwdriver. If it still refuses to budge, your only option is to break the pot. To break a plant out of a clay or ceramic pot, tap pot with a hammer until it shatters (save the pieces to use as drainage material). Thin plastic pots can be cut open with heavy-duty kitchen shears or a utility knife. 4a. Take a good look at what you have. If the roots form a solid mass, see if you can tease out a few that have wrapped into a tight spiral, and shorten them to the dimensions of the pot with a clean knife or pruning shears. This is often best done in a tub of water, or with the help of a hose and a gentle stream of running water. As you work, snip off any roots that appear black or dead, as well as those that unfurl into very long strands. There are exceptions, but most plants can be relieved of a quarter to a third of their roots as they are repotted. Don't worry about cutting the plant off at its knees, because root-pruned plants often rebound dramatically once they have settled into a new supply of fresh, clean potting medium. 4b. Alternatively, instead of trying to untangle the roots of houseplants that develop a dense network of fine, fibrous roots, remove the plant from its pot and stand it on a solid surface. Then use a sharp, serrated knife to slice four 1/2-inch-thick slabs from the sides of the root mass, so that it is trimmed into a cube. Repot into the same size container or a slightly larger one. 5. Place at least 1 inch or 2. 5 cm of fresh, moist potting mix in the bottom of the container, or line the bottom of the container with broken crockery or pebbles. Set the groomed plant in the pot so that it will be planted at the same depth in grew in its previous container. Fill the space between the edge of the root mass and the container with potting mix, and then use a table knife or chopstick to gently press the soil inward toward the plant's roots. 6. Add more soil, and tamp the container on a firm surface to help settle the particles in place. As long as the potting soil is nicely moist when you repot a plant, it is best to wait a few days before giving it a thorough watering. This delay in watering gives wounded roots a chance to wall off their injuries, and signals healthy roots to spread outward in search of water. 7. A few weeks after repotting, check the plant to look for spaces that may have developed between the edge of the pot and the soil by poking your finger into the potting mix. If needed, add a little fill soil to the top of the pot, but be sure to leave at least 0. 5 inch or 1. 25 cm of free space between the top of the potting mix and the rim of the pot.", "metadata": {"source": "The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual Essential Know-How for Keeping (Barbara Pleasant)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Care Instructions"}}, {"id": "houseplant(completeplants)_repotting_two_person_repotting", "title": "Houseplant Repotting - Two-Person Repotting Jobs", "content": "REPOTTING VERY LARGE PLANTS is a two-person job.

Instead, it is a mixture of growing media intended to do all the things soil does, without soil's negative side effects. Like soil, the medium should anchor the plant, provide particles to which tiny root hairs can cling, retain moisture until the plant needs it, yet not stay so wet that fungi and bacteria build up and cause roots to rot; You cannot dig such a substance from your yard. True soil is made up of very small particles that are teeming with microorganisms. In the secret world of outdoor soil, these microorganisms form a dynamic community regulated by changes in temperature, moisture, the movement of earthworms and insects, and the constant inflow and decomposition of various types of organic matter. Conditions in containers kept indoors are much less lively, and if problem-causing microorganisms become established, there is no way for beneficial ones to gain entrance to set things right. This is why houseplants need special potting soil made of materials that naturally suppress soil-borne diseases and that have been further processed to rid them of microbial contaminants. Of equal importance is the texture of potting soil, which is noticeably light and fluffy compared to the soil outside your front door; What is in the bag labeled 'potting soil'? Ingredients vary from one brand to another, but most are blended from peat moss, composted bark or other plant material, and sand or perlite (see pages 315-16). They also may include shiny particles of vermiculite, and most have had their pH fine tuned with lime (ground limestone) to bring it into the normal range. Many also contain small amounts of fertilizer to get plants off to a good start, but don't choose a potting soil based on its fertilizer content. Instead, look for dark color, a spongy texture, and little or no odor. You can easily provide plants with fertilizer on an as-needed basis; These days, potting soils are better than they have ever been, so it is easy to satisfy your plants' need for good soil. The best potting soils are packaged in plastic bags with zipper-type closures, which helps keep them moist while keeping out unwanted microorganisms. After trying several brands, most houseplant growers settle on a favorite. Nationally marketed brands are usually safe bets, but you may get equal satisfaction with a 'value' brand that costs less. If you keep only a few houseplants, a good all-purpose potting soil will probably meet your needs quite nicely. Buy no more than you think you will use in a few months, because opened bags of potting soil can become contaminated with microorganisms while also posing storage problems; Unfortunately, even the best potting soil does not last more than a couple of years after it is put to work in a pot. Organic matter breaks down, minerals are taken up by plants, and the medium's ability to do its job gradually deteriorates. This is why plants need periodic repotting even when they have not outgrown their pots. As for your old, used potting soil, throw it outside in your garden, or if you have no garden, dump it in a bag and give it to someone who does.

African violet soils often contain liberal amounts of peat moss (with lime added to offset its acidity) because of its moisture-holding talents. And the fine texture of peat moss makes it a valuable addition to seed-starting mixes, which are excellent for potting up newly rooted cuttings. On the down side, when a peaty soil dries out it can be difficult to remoisten. Before peat moss is packaged for sale or blended into potting soil, it is pulverized into a coarse brown powder.

The coarseness of these hard pieces aids drainage and helps prevent compaction, ensuring that plants enjoy plenty of air around their roots. There are environmental advantages, too. Most composted plant material begins as recycled waste from lumber and food-processing industries; in addition, it may include composted leaves collected from the yard; Nurserymen like using bark-based mediums because of their excellent drainage and low cost. Many plants like them because they break down slowly and mimic soil conditions in crevices between tree branches - the native niche of many bromeliads and orchids.

This is a plus for cacti and other plants that prefer moisture in brief gulps, so sand is often added to soils blended for cacti and succulents. Palms and other plants originating along seashores, such as screw pine (Pandanus), also respond well when grown in a sandy mixture. Indeed, whenever you suspect that a plant is suffering from poor drainage or needs drier root conditions, amending the soil with sand is a good first step. A half-and-half mixture of peat moss and sand also makes a fine medium for rooting stem cuttings. For all uses, be sure to use sand that has been washed to remove salt and other impurities, such as sand packaged for use in aquariums.

Perlite is chemically inert, with a neutral pH (7), so it has no chemical influence on soil beyond regulating water and oxygen. When adequate nutrition is provided, plants can grow in 100 percent perlite, and it makes a great medium for rooting cuttings.

Exceptions to this rule are noted in the plant profiles, because a few long-lived houseplants benefit from having clean, bagged garden soil added to their growing medium. 2. A few potting mixes contain insecticides that are taken up by plants. These can be an answered prayer if your palm is plagued with scale, but they should not be used to pot up plants with edible parts, such as calamondin orange or rosemary. 3. If you are not sure how much potting mix you need, check the label. Many products have charts on the package to help you compute how much is needed to fill containers of various sizes. When in doubt, buy a little more rather than less. 4. Store leftover potting soil tightly sealed in a cool, dry place. Use packing tape or clothespins to secure the top if the bag does not have a zipper-type closure. 5.

It seems reasonable to expect that actively growing houseplants that are enjoying the warm temperatures of summertime would need more water than plants resting their way through winter, but this is not necessarily true.

These are general tendencies, open to interpretation by different plants; 1. LIGHTLY MOIST, This first moisture level means that the plant benefits from soil that is never truly wet yet never completely dry. To achieve this result, you simply provide water frequently and take care to distribute it evenly in the container. Many plants that come from forests - both tropical and temperate - like to be kept lightly moist at all times. 2. MODERATELY MOIST, Plants that need moderate moisture often are fast growers with high light requirements. They include most of the indoor plants that produce beautiful flowers and a few robust foliage plants as well. Although somewhat demanding, these plants provide color and drama, and they often go into an annual recovery period of slow growth or dormancy when they need little or no water. The challenge is to provide ample moisture without getting carried away, because even plants that need abundant water can develop root rot or other problems if they are watered too much. 3. ALLOW TO DRY OUT BETWEEN WATERINGS, Many plants with succulent leaves or stems love to exercise their talent for hoarding moisture when water becomes available the same way they might if they were living in a climate where rains were few and far between. These are the plants that benefit from brief periods of dryness, and they often like their wet intervals to be short lived too. But all succulents are not alike in this respect, so it's best to pay attention to your plants' responses to watering and fine-tune your practices to please them.

You can't tell how much moisture is present deep in the container, and you know nothing about the most difficult area to water, the center of the plant's root mass.

When this happens, the plant's roots may remain much too dry. To avoid this difficulty, poke holes in the soil and root mass using an ice pick or a wooden skewer to create spaces through which water can flow and then percolate into surrounding soil. You should also make plans to repot the plant, since this problem is often a symptom that more root space and a fresh supply of potting soil are needed; Water will percolate more easily to a rootbound plant's interior roots if you make small holes in the soil with a skewer or ice pick; Although time consuming, bottom watering plants is often the best way to be certain that the lowest half of the root ball receives adequate moisture; Another potential problem with top watering are water spots that form on plant leaves, which is a common issue with African violets, gloxinias, and other plants that have downy leaf surfaces. When any of these top-watering complications are present, water plants from the bottom. To do this, pour water into a tray or saucer, set the plant in it, and allow the plant to drink its fill for up to 30 minutes before emptying out any excess water. The biggest risk with bottom watering is waterlogging of roots, which is seldom a problem in small containers but may be if the pot is very large and made of plastic or another material that holds water well. Never leave a pot sitting in standing water for more than 30 minutes; Most plants flourish when they are watered both ways - most often from the top, but occasionally from the bottom. Top watering is easy and practical, and leaf spotting can be minimized by watering in the morning and not soaking the leaves. Occasionally, do go to the trouble of bottom watering your plants.

When you're getting to know a new plant, it is better to err on the dry side than to drown its roots with too much water. In addition, be careful in the autumn. The reason? New growth slows as days become shorter, so plants need less water. And when plants are moved indoors after spending the summer outside, the absence of wind, combined with radically reduced light levels, further limits their need for water. Indoor humidity levels are often moderate in fall, too. When indoor humidity levels drop as the winter heating season begins, you can carefully increase watering until plants appear content.", "metadata": {"source": "The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual Essential Know-How for Keeping (Barbara Pleasant)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Care Instructions"}}, {"id": "houseplant(completeplants)_watering_tips", "title": "Houseplant Watering - Five Tips for Better Watering", "content": "There is Five Tips for Better Watering, 1. COMPANIONABLE CONTAINERS, Position plants with similar watering needs together whenever you can. You will be less likely to skip over plants that need frequent watering, and the mess that sometimes results from giving plants a thorough soaking can be limited to one area of your house. 2. OVERHEAD IRRIGATION, To water plants in hard-to-reach hanging planters, use a bulb-type turkey baster or a special watering bottle with an extra-long neck, which you can usually find at a garden center. If you're bothered by drips on floors or furniture, use string, hooks, and an aluminum roasting pan to create a drain tray to hang under the planter for a little while after watering. Or buy some inexpensive shower caps to temporarily enclose the bottoms of freshly watered hanging baskets. 3. HELPFUL HEADSPACE, When potting up indoor plants, always leave at least I-inch of space between the top edge of the container and the top of the soil. This space works like a reservoir when you're watering, giving water a place to sit until it can soak in. It also helps prevent spills of soil or water. 4. HIDE A WATER SUPPLY, If you have only one or two plants in a room that's far from your kitchen (or wherever you keep your watering can or bottle), hide a bottle of water behind the pots so it will always be there, ready to offer a few sips. 5. CLEAN OUT DRAINAGE TRAYS, Many plants benefit from sitting on a bed of damp pebbles, which increases humidity while catching excess water that drains from the pots. As this water evaporates, salts are often left behind on the pebbles. This becomes a problem when plants take up water from the trays, which may be heavily laced with salts. To avoid problems, empty and thoroughly rinse drainage trays, and the pebbles within them, about once a month.", "metadata": {"source": "The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual Essential Know-How for Keeping (Barbara Pleasant)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Care Instructions"}}, {"id": "houseplant(completeplants)_Wind_basic", "title": "Houseplant Wind - Basic Information", "content": "Just as plant leaves make physical changes to adapt to increasing or decreasing levels of light, stems alter their structure to better cope with movement, which typically comes from wind. As long as plants are kept indoors, they encounter very little moving air. Their stems do not need to be tough, and so they often are comprised of cells arranged in straight patterns. In comparison, plants that are exposed to moving air respond by arranging their stem cells in more twisted patterns, which makes them less prone to bruising and breakage; The transition from tender stems to tougher, wind-resistant stems takes time, so you should acclimate plants to wind that are being moved outdoors the same way you acclimate them to increasing light. Frequently these two goals can be accomplished together. Begin by placing plants in a shady spot that is protected from strong wind and sun, and gradually move them to a more open environment, over a period of 1 to 2 weeks; Even properly acclimated houseplants may suffer wind damage when exposed to high winds outdoors. When very blustery weather is predicted, move houseplants to a protected spot, such as against the outer walls of your house, or simply bring them indoors until calm weather returns. In addition to twisting or breaking stems and leaves, wind can easily topple plants, which can lead to devastating damage; You also can condition your plants indoors by running a gentle fan, which will cause enough air movement to trigger a response from the plants' stems. In winter, you can keep your plants physically fit by talking to them as you water and groom them. The gentle puffs of air from your breath causes slight air movement, too; Beautiful form, flawless texture, and a well-chosen container combine to make a mounding philodendron glow with satisfaction.", "metadata": {"source": "The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual Essential Know-How for Keeping (Barbara Pleasant)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Care Instructions"}}, {"id": "plant_info(completeplants)_chinese_evergreen_basic_description", "title": "Chinese Evergreen (Aglaonema) - Description", "content": "One of the easiest foliage plantsS to grow, Chinese evergreen tolerates low light better than most other houseplants.

The leaves dangle and become flaccid. The growing tips of the stems droop and point to the ground. The whole plant suffers and, if the situation is not reversed, your plant will die. Wilting is a serious, life-threatening condition that results from four causes; The most frequent cause of wilting is that you forgot to water your plant. If you find to your horror that your plant has wilted because you forgot to water it, give it water immediately. Most plants will rehydrate quickly and suffer no consequences. If the potting medium is completely dry it may be reluctant to absorb water so immerse the entire pot in a bucket of water until it is completely saturated, then let it drain. Your plant should recover within a few hours. If it does not recover, it's dead. If your plant has wilted even though you've watered it regularly and the potting medium has ample moisture, suspect root rot, the second most frequent cause of wilting. Gently extract the plant from its pot without breaking stems or roots. Inspect the root system. If roots are mushy, and gray, black, or dark brown, then the root system has been invaded by a pathogenic fungus that has killed and eaten the roots; A third cause for wilting is that your plant is in a pot that is too small for it. If your plant has wilted, and you're certain you've watered it properly, and you've checked the root system and found it to be alive and healthy, your plant is most likely in too small a pot (rootbound). Plants that are rootbound have essentially filled their container with roots and there is not enough moisture-holding medium left in the pot. The roots run out of water shortly after watering and the plant wilts again. You need to do one of two things. Either up-pot your plant to a larger container with fresh potting medium, or re-pot your plant after trimming away excess roots; A less frequent but nevertheless important cause of wilting is hot moving air, as from a heat vent or space heater, sucking the water out of the leaves faster than the plant can handle. If your plant wilts and you know it has sufficient water, does not have root rot, and it is not rootbound, then check for sources of hot moving air. Usually a heat vent from a forced air furnace or an electric space heater will be the culprit.

A plant has to have nitrogen in order to grow new leaves, roots, stems, and so forth. High nitrogen promotes the lush growth of green leaves, so that any houseplant grown primarily for its attractive foliage, as opposed to flowers, needs a high-nitrogen fertilizer. Phosphorus (the middle number) is necessary for flowering and strong roots. Plants need phosphorus in order to initiate, develop, and maintain their flowers. This is why the percent of phosphorus is high in fertilizers designed for flowering bulbs.

Losing water through its leaves is a vital and necessary process for your plant. Just as your heart beats to pump blood to every cell in your body, so transpiration bathes every cell in a plant's body in nutrients carried by water; If humidity is high a plant loses water more slowly from its leaves. If humidity is low a plant loses water rapidly from its leaves. Two other factors influence this process. First is the availability of water. If your potting medium is adequately moist then the plant is able to mine the soil with its roots for the water it needs. Conversely, if water is not available because you forgot to water and the medium is dry, then your plant can get into trouble quickly. The second factor is ambient air temperature. As the air temperature goes up humidity goes down; as the temperature goes down humidity goes up. Placing your plant too close to a hot air register or other heat source will suck the water right out of the leaves very quickly; Depending on your climate, dry or humid, you may need to mist your indoor plants about once a week, as we did when we lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

The amount of time they can live with out light depends on how much sugar, starch, or complex carbohydrates they have manufactured and stored in their tissues. If they cannot manu facture food they have to metabolize stored food until the stores run out. Without light, plants starve to death; All houseplants originally came to us from native habitats where they had evolved and adapted to local environmental conditions for millions of years. Houseplants whose native habitat is the shady floor of a rainforest, for example, thrive under low light conditions. But keep in mind that even in shady natural habi tats, plants are not really in permanent shade. They still receive a significant amount of ambi ent light from the sky (aka skylight: blue light that radiates from the sky). Conversely, plants whose native habitat is the brilliant sun of a des ert require the maximum amount of light your home can provide; The intensity and duration of light, and a plant's distance from the light source are the most important environmental parameters to consider as you prepare for success with any houseplant. Houses designed for humans are dark compared to houses built for plants-such as a greenhouse filled with bright light. When we bring a companion plant into our homes we need to be very cognizant of the intensity of light that particular plant needs and how long it needs it. In the plant portraits section of this book each plant's light requirement, whether high, medium, or low, is listed; As you place your plants in the right light, bear in mind that they need to be acclimated to their new home. Acclimatize a recently acquired plant to full sun slowly over a period of a cou ple of weeks. Give it two hours a day for four days, then four hours a day for four days, then six hours for four days, and so forth.

The first thing you'll need to do is figure out which window faces which direction. In the morning, when you're having your coffee, which window gives you the best view of the sunrise? That window faces east. As you face that east window, know that south is on your right and north is on your left. West is behind you; The second thing you'll need to figure out is how far away from the window your plant is going to live. If the leaves of your plant are 2 feet away from the window then your plant is only getting one-fourth of the light it would receive if it were right next to the window. This phe nomenon is called the inverse square law, and you can use this simple mathematical formula to help your plants get the light they need. Who knew there'd be math when all you want to do is grow a plant? But really, it's simple. All you need is a tape measure and a calculator (or a piece of paper and pencil if you're old school); According to this law, the intensity of light decreases as the square of the distance from the source of the light.

Well, almost anywhere, and not all houseplants; A very large array of light fixtures suitable for houseplants is available today. They range from simple desk lamps with containers for houseplants at the base to complex systems of multi-stacked shelves with lighting above each shelf. With these light systems in place, any dark corner can be brightened up with houseplants; No matter what system you use, choose a light source that gives off the proper wave lengths of light for your plant. Different kinds of bulbs emit different wavelengths of light, and plants use different wavelengths of light for dif ferent purposes. You need blue and red light if all you want is good foliage growth, but you need red and far red light if you want your plant to make flowers. Look at the packaging the bulb comes in to determine its light quality; Standard cool-white daylight fluorescent tubes emit light in the blue and red range and are very suitable for vegetative growth. They do a very good job for foliage plants. The spe cial fluorescent bulbs designed to promote plant growth and flowering, called grow lights, are expensive but are designed to emit the right quality of light (blue, red, and far red). They also avoid the heat load generated by incandescent, high-intensity discharge lamps, high pressure sodium, and metal halide lights. LED lights are a low-heat artificial light source, as well as being energy efficient; A final consideration is the size of the plant you want to grow. Tall plants, like palms, other trees, and large shrubs, are very difficult (often impossible) to get close enough to your light source for the light to do much good due to the inverse square law discussed earlier; Your best option for growing houseplants under artificial lights in your home is to concentrate on low-growing plants that can be positioned close to the bulbs.

Check by pulling the plant out of its pot and looking at the root ball. This will not harm the plant if you treat it gently; If there are only a few roots visible on the sides of the root ball and the potting medium starts to fall apart when you poke it with your finger just push the plant back into its container and wait a year or so before up-potting. If you pull your plant out of its cheap plastic container and the root ball is covered by a healthy network of white roots strongly holding together the mass of potting medium in a compact ball, then you can go ahead and up-pot your plant into a larger container; Another factor to consider is the rate at which plants grow. Some houseplants grow slowly by nature and some grow fast, but both will eventually need to be up-potted. When you're certain your plant is ready for a new, larger pot, use a tape measure to determine the diameter of the old original pot. It's important to know the size of the container whenever it comes time to move your plant up to a larger pot; The new pot should be no more than 2 to 4 inches larger than the current pot. Why? Because a small plant with a small root system is physically incapable of mining a large volume of soil for moisture with the result that the potting medium stays too wet too long and the roots rot. You have to move a plant up in increments until you get your plant into the size of pot you want it to live in for a very long time; For a slow-growing plant the new pot should be 2 inches larger in diameter. For a fast-growing plant the new pot should be 4 inches larger. In other words, when you up-pot a slow-growing plant in a 4-inch pot, move it into a 6-inch pot. This will give you 1 inch of fresh potting medium packed around all sides of the root ball. When you up-pot a fast-growing plant in a 4-inch pot, put it into an 8-inch pot. This will give you 2 inches of fresh potting medium packed around all sides of the root ball. A really vigorous plant growing rapidly will quickly fill 2 inches of fresh potting medium with healthy roots, but a slow-growing plant cannot do so; Keep in mind that some houseplants are destined to always be small, even when fully mature. An African violet comes to mind as a kind of plant that can never become large, like a tree. It will always be small even when fully mature and can live quite happily in a 4-inch pot. A rubber tree in a 4-inch pot, by contrast, will quickly outgrow the pot and need to be up-potted to a bigger container. Since the rubber tree is a forest giant in the wild, it can easily reach the ceiling in your home if you give it a large enough pot.", "metadata": {"source": "Whats Wrong With My Houseplant Save Your Indoor Plants With 100 Organic Solutions (David C Deardorff, Kathryn B Wadsworth)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Care Instructions"}}, {"id": "houseplant(wrongplants)_potting_repotting", "title": "Houseplant Potting - Re-potting", "content": "If your houseplant has reached the perfect size for your space (i. e. , you do not want it to get much larger than it is), you don't want to move it into a larger pot.

Plants with flexible specialized stems called stolons (like spider plant and creeping saxifrage) are also easily handled with this technique. All you need to do is select a container for your newly propagated plant to grow in and fill it with the potting medium appropriate for the plant in question. Moisten the potting medium with water, let it drain, and set the container close enough to your mother plant to allow you to pick up a healthy stem or stolon and lay it on the surface of the container; STOLONS. If you're working with a stolon, there will be little plantlets at its nodes. Adjust the position of your pot and stolon to place one of these little plantlets in the center of your container. Use a U-shaped staple or piece of wire to pin the stolon to the potting medium with the little roots pushed down into the soil. The roots will be stimulated by the moist potting medium and will begin to grow. In a few weeks, when the little plant is well rooted and actively growing new leaves, you can cut the stolon and sever the connection between the little plant and the mother plant; VINES. To propagate a vine, such as pothos, adjust the position of your pot to place the fourth leaf from the tip of the stem in the center of your container. The place where the leaf attaches to the stem is a node. There will usually be one or two fat little roots sticking out of the node on the side of the stem opposite the leaf. Push these little roots down into the soil. Use a U-shaped staple or piece of wire to pin the stem to the potting medium with the leaf pointing up. Cut the leaf off with a clean, sterilized, sharp knife or pruners and discard it; You now have a length of stem with three leaves on it on the side of the node away from the mother plant. The stem is still connected to the mother plant. The roots at the node pinned to the potting medium will be stimulated by the moist medium and will begin to grow; In a few weeks, the dormant bud at the node where the leaf you removed was attached to the stem will have grown out into a new stem and will be well rooted. At this point you cut the stem between the little plantlet and the mother plant to sever the tie between them.

This is the most time-consuming and trickiest method of propagation for houseplants but is, nevertheless, a valuable tool for plants such as rubber tree and fiddle-leaf fig that are difficult or impossible to root using easier methods. As in simple layering, what you're attempting to do is to make a stem grow roots while it's still attached to the mother plant. But, unlike vines or stolons, these plants have rigid, non-flexible stems so it's very difficult to bend such a stem down to attach it to a container of potting medium without breaking it. The solution is to bring the potting medium up to the plant. Here are the 12 steps to successfully propagate plants by air layering: 1. Select a point 8 to 12 inches down from the tip of a healthy young stem and, using a clean, sterilized, sharp knife cut one-third of the way into the stem at an upward angle just below a node (the place where a leaf was attached to the stem). Do not cut more than one-third of the way through the stem, and support the stem above the wound so that it doesn't break off. 2. Remove a leaf or two if they are in your way. 3. When you wound them, rubber tree or fiddle-leaf fig will bleed milky white sap that dries to rubber. Wipe away the sap with a damp cloth. 4. Prop the wound open by inserting a toothpick sideways into the cut. 5. Put rooting hormones in the wound and wrap the wound with a couple handfuls of moistened, stringy, sphagnum moss. 6. While holding the moss in place, wrap the ball of moss in a cylinder of two layers of plastic. 7. Tape the top and bottom shut with electrical tape but leave the top of the package loose enough to add water to the inside. 8. Pour enough water inside every few days to keep the sphagnum moss moist. 9. In a month or two you'll see new roots forming inside the plastic, but sometimes it can take six to eight months for roots to form, so be patient. 10. When the new roots are about 2 inches long, remove the plastic wrapping, cut the stem off the parent plant just below the new little root ball. Do not remove the sphagnum moss from the root ball. 11. Pot up your new plant. 12.

If you want to make an identical copy of your plants then you need to propagate them asexually by division, cuttings, or layering; Specialty seed companies offer seeds of many houseplants with clear instructions printed on the package or in their catalogs regarding the appropriate sowing medium, sowing depth, soil temperature, watering, and the light regime each kind of seed needs in order to germinate successfully.", "metadata": {"source": "Whats Wrong With My Houseplant Save Your Indoor Plants With 100 Organic Solutions (David C Deardorff, Kathryn B Wadsworth)", "credibility": "High", "category": "Care Instructions"}}, {"id": "houseplant(wrongplants)_temperature_basic", "title": "Houseplant Temperature - Basic Information", "content": "Success with a particular houseplant depends on knowing the daily temperature regime (daytime high and nighttime low) that plant needs to flourish under your care. Fortunately, plants are fairly forgiving and will adjust to day or night temperatures within a range of about ten degrees Fahrenhreit. The plant portrait of each houseplant specifies the appropriate temperature range, daytime and nighttime, for best suc cess with that plant; Night temperatures are critical for houseplants because plants cannot manufacture food (sugar) through photosynthesis when the sun is not shining. In order to maintain metabolism and growth at night the plant has to burn some of the food it made during the day. For plants, metabolizing food is called respiration. Respiration is the exact opposite process from photosynthesis and it is critically linked to tem perature. As the temperature goes up metabolism goes up. As the nighttime temperature goes higher a plant will reach a point where it has burned up all the food it made during the day. At even higher temperatures it will burn up all its reserve food supply. Pretty soon the plant will be dead. This is why those irresistibly cute little miniature roses in 4-inch pots die within a couple weeks when you bring them home from the store. The warm nighttime temperature of our homes kills them.

Unglazed clay (terracotta) pots are porous. Water evaporates through the walls of these pots very well so they dry out pretty quickly. In garden jargon these pots are said to breathe. Plastic pots, or glazed ceramic, glass, or metal pots do not breathe. Their walls are impervious to water so the potting medium stays moist much longer than in unglazed clay pots; Ambient air temperature, humidity, and daylength also play a role with regard to frequency of watering. A houseplant's need for water goes up when the temperature goes up, or when it bursts into active growth, or begins to flower. On hot, dry summer days you need to water houseplants more frequently than on cool, moist winter days-even though the plants are inside the house and protected from temperature extremes; Another factor to consider with regard to watering your houseplants is the potting medium itself. A general-purpose potting medium is designed to absorb and retain sufficient moisture, to allow free water to drain away adequately, and also to provide ample air for good root growth. Some potting media, African violet mixes for example, are designed to retain a little more moisture than a general-purpose potting medium.

If the pot is propped up on pot feet or pebbles so that the bottom of the pot does not sit in a pool of water, you can let the water stand in the saucer. This standing water will help increase humidity. If your pot is not propped up on pot feet or pebbles, check back within 30 minutes to an hour.
