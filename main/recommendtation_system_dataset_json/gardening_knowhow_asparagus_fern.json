        "content": "There are a number of asparagus species called asparagus fern, and each one is slightly different. Asparagus densiflorus, known as asparagus fern, has fern-like foliage in an arching mound to 3 feet (0. 9 m) tall. Asparagus setaceus, also called asparagus fern, is a bushy, evergreen vine that can grow to 20 feet (6 m) long.
