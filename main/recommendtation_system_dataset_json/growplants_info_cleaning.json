        "content": "Houseplants are dust magnets, but foliage can be refreshed by a regular clean with a soft, damp cloth-a quick wipe should leave it looking its best. A thick layer of dust stops the leaf from absorbing sunlight and reduces the plant's ability to perform photosynthesis (the process by which plants convert energy from sunlight into food for growth). Clean the underside of the leaves too, as this is where pests lurk. Avoid wiping the leaves of plants that have fluffy foliage, such as African violets, as this will damage them. Use a paintbrush to remove dust and potting mix from spiky cacti-it's the perfect tool for this task. It's important to wash your cleaning cloths regularly to prevent the spread of pests and diseases from one plant to another. If you have several plants, you'll need more than one cloth.",
