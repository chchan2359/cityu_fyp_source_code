Water should be able to drain from the bottom of containers. Severely damaged plants should be discarded. Various Root Rots: Pull plant out of the pot and observe roots for discoloration. Diseased roots will appear dark and soft. Remove diseased plants from their pots, cut out infested portions (rotten), and replant remaining healthy sections. Take cuttings and root them in sterile potting mix. Stem Cankers: Discolored areas on stem. Prune out affected areas.",
